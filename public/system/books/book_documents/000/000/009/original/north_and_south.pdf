T*(compelled to hurry on events with an improbable rapidity towards)Tj

T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*('HASTE TO THE WEDDING')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Wooed and married and a'.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Edith!' said Margaret, gently, 'Edith!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But, as Margaret half suspected, Edith had fallen asleep. She lay)Tj
T*(curled up on the sofa in the back drawing-room in Harley Street,)Tj
T*(looking very lovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons. If)Tj
T*(Titania had ever been dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons,)Tj
T*(and had fallen asleep on a crimson damask sofa in a back)Tj
T*(drawing-room, Edith might have been taken for her. Margaret was)Tj
T*(struck afresh by her cousin's beauty. They had grown up together)Tj
T*(from childhood, and all along Edith had been remarked upon by)Tj
T*(every one, except Margaret, for her prettiness; but Margaret had)Tj
T*(never thought about it until the last few days, when the prospect)Tj
T*(of soon losing her companion seemed to give force to every sweet)Tj
T*(quality and charm which Edith possessed. They had been talking)Tj
T*(about wedding dresses, and wedding ceremonies; and Captain)Tj
T*(Lennox, and what he had told Edith about her future life at)Tj
T*(Corfu, where his regiment was stationed; and the difficulty of)Tj
T*(keeping a piano in good tune \(a difficulty which Edith seemed to)Tj
T*(consider as one of the most formidable that could befall her in)Tj
T*(her married life\), and what gowns she should want in the visits)Tj
T*(to Scotland, which would immediately succeed her marriage; but)Tj
T*(the whispered tone had latterly become more drowsy; and Margaret,)Tj
T*(after a pause of a few minutes, found, as she fancied, that in)Tj
T*(spite of the buzz in the next room, Edith had rolled herself up)Tj
T*(into a soft ball of muslin and ribbon, and silken curls, and gone)Tj
T*(off into a peaceful little after-dinner nap.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret had been on the point of telling her cousin of some of)Tj
T*(the plans and visions which she entertained as to her future life)Tj
T*(in the country parsonage, where her father and mother lived; and)Tj
T*(where her bright holidays had always been passed, though for the)Tj
T*(last ten years her aunt Shaw's house had been considered as her)Tj
T*(home. But in default of a listener, she had to brood over the)Tj
T*(change in her life silently as heretofore. It was a happy)Tj
T*(brooding, although tinged with regret at being separated for an)Tj
T*(indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear cousin. As she)Tj
T*(thought of the delight of filling the important post of only)Tj
T*(daughter in Helstone parsonage, pieces of the conversation out of)Tj
T*(the next room came upon her ears. Her aunt Shaw was talking to)Tj
T*(the five or six ladies who had been dining there, and whose)Tj

T*(husbands were still in the dining-room. They were the familiar)Tj
T*(acquaintances of the house; neighbours whom Mrs. Shaw called)Tj
T*(friends, because she happened to dine with them more frequently)Tj
T*(than with any other people, and because if she or Edith wanted)Tj
T*(anything from them, or they from her, they did not scruple to)Tj
T*(make a call at each other's houses before luncheon. These ladies)Tj
T*(and their husbands were invited, in their capacity of friends, to)Tj
T*(eat a farewell dinner in honour of Edith's approaching marriage.)Tj
T*(Edith had rather objected to this arrangement, for Captain Lennox)Tj
T*(was expected to arrive by a late train this very evening; but,)Tj
T*(although she was a spoiled child, she was too careless and idle)Tj
T*(to have a very strong will of her own, and gave way when she)Tj
T*(found that her mother had absolutely ordered those extra)Tj
T*(delicacies of the season which are always supposed to be)Tj
T*(efficacious against immoderate grief at farewell dinners. She)Tj
T*(contented herself by leaning back in her chair, merely playing)Tj
T*(with the food on her plate, and looking grave and absent; while)Tj
T*(all around her were enjoying the mots of Mr. Grey, the gentleman)Tj
T*(who always took the bottom of the table at Mrs. Shaw's dinner)Tj
T*(parties, and asked Edith to give them some music in the)Tj
T*(drawing-room. Mr. Grey was particularly agreeable over this)Tj
T*(farewell dinner, and the gentlemen staid down stairs longer than)Tj
T*(usual. It was very well they did--to judge from the fragments of)Tj
T*(conversation which Margaret overheard.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I suffered too much myself; not that I was not extremely happy)Tj
T*(with the poor dear General, but still disparity of age is a)Tj
T*(drawback; one that I was resolved Edith should not have to)Tj
T*(encounter. Of course, without any maternal partiality, I foresaw)Tj
T*(that the dear child was likely to marry early; indeed, I had)Tj
T*(often said that I was sure she would be married before she was)Tj
T*(nineteen. I had quite a prophetic feeling when Captain)Tj
T*(Lennox'--and here the voice dropped into a whisper, but Margaret)Tj
T*(could easily supply the blank. The course of true love in Edith's)Tj
T*(case had run remarkably smooth. Mrs. Shaw had given way to the)Tj
T*(presentiment, as she expressed it; and had rather urged on the)Tj
T*(marriage, although it was below the expectations which many of)Tj
T*(Edith's acquaintances had formed for her, a young and pretty)Tj
T*(heiress. But Mrs. Shaw said that her only child should marry for)Tj
T*(love,--and sighed emphatically, as if love had not been her)Tj
T*(motive for marrying the General. Mrs. Shaw enjoyed the romance of)Tj
T*(the present engagement rather more than her daughter. Not but)Tj
T*(that Edith was very thoroughly and properly in love; still she)Tj
T*(would certainly have preferred a good house in Belgravia, to all)Tj
T*(the picturesqueness of the life which Captain Lennox described at)Tj
T*(Corfu. The very parts which made Margaret glow as she listened,)Tj
T*(Edith pretended to shiver and shudder at; partly for the pleasure)Tj
T*(she had in being coaxed out of her dislike by her fond lover, and)Tj
T*(partly because anything of a gipsy or make-shift life was really)Tj
T*(distasteful to her. Yet had any one come with a fine house, and a)Tj
T*(fine estate, and a fine title to boot, Edith would still have)Tj
T*(clung to Captain Lennox while the temptation lasted; when it was)Tj
T*(over, it is possible she might have had little qualms of)Tj
T*(ill-concealed regret that Captain Lennox could not have united in)Tj
T*(his person everything that was desirable. In this she was but her)Tj
T*(mother's child; who, after deliberately marrying General Shaw)Tj
T*(with no warmer feeling than respect for his character and)Tj
T*(establishment, was constantly, though quietly, bemoaning her hard)Tj
T*(lot in being united to one whom she could not love.)Tj

T*('I have spared no expense in her trousseau,' were the next words)Tj
T*(Margaret heard.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She has all the beautiful Indian shawls and scarfs the General)Tj
T*(gave to me, but which I shall never wear again.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She is a lucky girl,' replied another voice, which Margaret knew)Tj
T*(to be that of Mrs. Gibson, a lady who was taking a double)Tj
T*(interest in the conversation, from the fact of one of her)Tj
T*(daughters having been married within the last few weeks.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Helen had set her heart upon an Indian shawl, but really when I)Tj
T*(found what an extravagant price was asked, I was obliged to)Tj
T*(refuse her. She will be quite envious when she hears of Edith)Tj
T*(having Indian shawls. What kind are they? Delhi? with the lovely)Tj
T*(little borders?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret heard her aunt's voice again, but this time it was as if)Tj
T*(she had raised herself up from her half-recumbent position, and)Tj
T*(were looking into the more dimly lighted back drawing-room.)Tj
T*('Edith! Edith!' cried she; and then she sank as if wearied by the)Tj
T*(exertion. Margaret stepped forward.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Edith is asleep, Aunt Shaw. Is it anything I can do?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(All the ladies said 'Poor child!' on receiving this distressing)Tj
T*(intelligence about Edith; and the minute lap-dog in Mrs. Shaw's)Tj
T*(arms began to bark, as if excited by the burst of pity.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Hush, Tiny! you naughty little girl! you will waken your)Tj
T*(mistress. It was only to ask Edith if she would tell Newton to)Tj
T*(bring down her shawls: perhaps you would go, Margaret dear?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret went up into the old nursery at the very top of the)Tj
T*(house, where Newton was busy getting up some laces which were)Tj
T*(required for the wedding. While Newton went \(not without a)Tj
T*(muttered grumbling\) to undo the shawls, which had already been)Tj
T*(exhibited four or five times that day, Margaret looked round upon)Tj
T*(the nursery; the first room in that house with which she had)Tj
T*(become familiar nine years ago, when she was brought, all untamed)Tj
T*(from the forest, to share the home, the play, and the lessons of)Tj
T*(her cousin Edith. She remembered the dark, dim look of the London)Tj
T*(nursery, presided over by an austere and ceremonious nurse, who)Tj
T*(was terribly particular about clean hands and torn frocks. She)Tj
T*(recollected the first tea up there--separate from her father and)Tj
T*(aunt, who were dining somewhere down below an infinite depth of)Tj
T*(stairs; for unless she were up in the sky \(the child thought\),)Tj
T*(they must be deep down in the bowels of the earth. At)Tj
T*(home--before she came to live in Harley Street--her mother's)Tj
T*(dressing-room had been her nursery; and, as they kept early hours)Tj
T*(in the country parsonage, Margaret had always had her meals with)Tj
T*(her father and mother. Oh! well did the tall stately girl of)Tj
T*(eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief)Tj
T*(by the little girl of nine, as she hid her face under the)Tj
T*(bed-clothes, in that first night; and how she was bidden not to)Tj
T*(cry by the nurse, because it would disturb Miss Edith; and how)Tj
T*(she had cried as bitterly, but more quietly, till her newly-seen,)Tj
T*(grand, pretty aunt had come softly upstairs with Mr. Hale to show)Tj
T*(him his little sleeping daughter. Then the little Margaret had)Tj
T*(hushed her sobs, and tried to lie quiet as if asleep, for fear of)Tj

T*(making her father unhappy by her grief, which she dared not)Tj
T*(express before her aunt, and which she rather thought it was)Tj
T*(wrong to feel at all after the long hoping, and planning, and)Tj
T*(contriving they had gone through at home, before her wardrobe)Tj
T*(could be arranged so as to suit her grander circumstances, and)Tj
T*(before papa could leave his parish to come up to London, even for)Tj
T*(a few days.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Now she had got to love the old nursery, though it was but a)Tj
T*(dismantled place; and she looked all round, with a kind of)Tj
T*(cat-like regret, at the idea of leaving it for ever in three)Tj
T*(days.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ah Newton!' said she, 'I think we shall all be sorry to leave)Tj
T*(this dear old room.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Indeed, miss, I shan't for one. My eyes are not so good as they)Tj
T*(were, and the light here is so bad that I can't see to mend laces)Tj
T*(except just at the window, where there's always a shocking)Tj
T*(draught--enough to give one one's death of cold.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Well, I dare say you will have both good light and plenty of)Tj
T*(warmth at Naples. You must keep as much of your darning as you)Tj
T*(can till then. Thank you, Newton, I can take them down--you're)Tj
T*(busy.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(So Margaret went down laden with shawls, and snuffing up their)Tj
T*(spicy Eastern smell. Her aunt asked her to stand as a sort of lay)Tj
T*(figure on which to display them, as Edith was still asleep. No)Tj
T*(one thought about it; but Margaret's tall, finely made figure, in)Tj
T*(the black silk dress which she was wearing as mourning for some)Tj
T*(distant relative of her father's, set off the long beautiful)Tj
T*(folds of the gorgeous shawls that would have half-smothered)Tj
T*(Edith. Margaret stood right under the chandelier, quite silent)Tj
T*(and passive, while her aunt adjusted the draperies. Occasionally,)Tj
T*(as she was turned round, she caught a glimpse of herself in the)Tj
T*(mirror over the chimney-piece, and smiled at her own appearance)Tj
T*(there-the familiar features in the usual garb of a princess. She)Tj
T*(touched the shawls gently as they hung around her, and took a)Tj
T*(pleasure in their soft feel and their brilliant colours, and)Tj
T*(rather liked to be dressed in such splendour--enjoying it much as)Tj
T*(a child would do, with a quiet pleased smile on her lips. Just)Tj
T*(then the door opened, and Mr. Henry Lennox was suddenly)Tj
T*(announced. Some of the ladies started back, as if half-ashamed of)Tj
T*(their feminine interest in dress. Mrs. Shaw held out her hand to)Tj
T*(the new-comer; Margaret stood perfectly still, thinking she might)Tj
T*(be yet wanted as a sort of block for the shawls; but looking at)Tj
T*(Mr. Lennox with a bright, amused face, as if sure of his sympathy)Tj
T*(in her sense of the ludicrousness at being thus surprised.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Her aunt was so much absorbed in asking Mr. Henry Lennox--who had)Tj
T*(not been able to come to dinner--all sorts of questions about his)Tj
T*(brother the bridegroom, his sister the bridesmaid \(coming with)Tj
T*(the Captain from Scotland for the occasion\), and various other)Tj
T*(members of the Lennox family, that Margaret saw she was no more)Tj
T*(wanted as shawl-bearer, and devoted herself to the amusement of)Tj
T*(the other visitors, whom her aunt had for the moment forgotten.)Tj
T*(Almost immediately, Edith came in from the back drawing-room,)Tj
T*(winking and blinking her eyes at the stronger light, shaking back)Tj
T*(her slightly-ruffled curls, and altogether looking like the)Tj

T*(Sleeping Beauty just startled from her dreams. Even in her)Tj
T*(slumber she had instinctively felt that a Lennox was worth)Tj
T*(rousing herself for; and she had a multitude of questions to ask)Tj
T*(about dear Janet, the future, unseen sister-in-law, for whom she)Tj
T*(professed so much affection, that if Margaret had not been very)Tj
T*(proud she might have almost felt jealous of the mushroom rival.)Tj
T*(As Margaret sank rather more into the background on her aunt's)Tj
T*(joining the conversation, she saw Henry Lennox directing his look)Tj
T*(towards a vacant seat near her; and she knew perfectly well that)Tj
T*(as soon as Edith released him from her questioning, he would take)Tj
T*(possession of that chair. She had not been quite sure, from her)Tj
T*(aunt's rather confused account of his engagements, whether he)Tj
T*(would come that night; it was almost a surprise to see him; and)Tj
T*(now she was sure of a pleasant evening. He liked and disliked)Tj
T*(pretty nearly the same things that she did. Margaret's face was)Tj
T*(lightened up into an honest, open brightness. By-and-by he came.)Tj
T*(She received him with a smile which had not a tinge of shyness or)Tj
T*(self-consciousness in it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, I suppose you are all in the depths of business--ladies')Tj
T*(business, I mean. Very different to my business, which is the)Tj
T*(real true law business. Playing with shawls is very different)Tj
T*(work to drawing up settlements.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ah, I knew how you would be amused to find us all so occupied in)Tj
T*(admiring finery. But really Indian shawls are very perfect things)Tj
T*(of their kind.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I have no doubt they are. Their prices are very perfect, too.)Tj
T*(Nothing wanting.' The gentlemen came dropping in one by one, and)Tj
T*(the buzz and noise deepened in tone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('This is your last dinner-party, is it not? There are no more)Tj
T*(before Thursday?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No. I think after this evening we shall feel at rest, which I am)Tj
T*(sure I have not done for many weeks; at least, that kind of rest)Tj
T*(when the hands have nothing more to do, and all the arrangements)Tj
T*(are complete for an event which must occupy one's head and heart.)Tj

T*(Whenever I have seen you lately, you have been carried away by a)Tj

T*()Tj

T*(church through the shade of trees; and not to have so many)Tj
T*(bridesmaids, and to have no wedding-breakfast. I dare say I am)Tj

T*(more, from remembering former occasions on which he had tried to)Tj
T*(lead her into a discussion \(in which he took the complimentary)Tj
T*(part\) about her own character and ways of going on. She cut his)Tj
T*(speech rather short by saying:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is natural for me to think of Helstone church, and the walk)Tj
T*(to it, rather than of driving up to a London church in the middle)Tj
T*(of a paved street.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Tell me about Helstone. You have never described it to me. I)Tj
T*(should like to have some idea of the place you will be living in,)Tj
T*(when ninety-six Harley Street will be looking dingy and dirty,)Tj
T*(and dull, and shut up. Is Helstone a village, or a town, in the)Tj
T*(first place?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, only a hamlet; I don't think I could call it a village at)Tj
T*(all. There is the church and a few houses near it on the)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I am penitent,' he answered. 'Only it really sounded like a)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('And so it is,' replied Margaret, eagerly. 'All the other places)Tj
T*(in England that I have seen seem so hard and prosaic-looking,)Tj

T*(one of Tennyson's poems. But I won't try and describe it any)Tj

T*(from the long habit of considering herself a victim to an)Tj
T*(uncongenial marriage. Now that, the General being gone, she had)Tj
T*(every good of life, with as few drawbacks as possible, she had)Tj
T*(been rather perplexed to find an anxiety, if not a sorrow. She)Tj
T*(had, however, of late settled upon her own health as a source of)Tj
T*(apprehension; she had a nervous little cough whenever she thought)Tj
T*(about it; and some complaisant doctor ordered her just what she)Tj
T*(desired,--a winter in Italy. Mrs. Shaw had as strong wishes as)Tj
T*(most people, but she never liked to do anything from the open and)Tj
T*(acknowledged motive of her own good will and pleasure; she)Tj
T*(preferred being compelled to gratify herself by some other)Tj
T*(person's command or desire. She really did persuade herself that)Tj
T*(she was submitting to some hard external necessity; and thus she)Tj

T*(Mr. Henry Lennox stood leaning against the chimney-piece, amused)Tj
T*(with the family scene. He was close by his handsome brother; he)Tj
T*(was the plain one in a singularly good-looking family; but his)Tj
T*(face was intelligent, keen, and mobile; and now and then Margaret)Tj
T*(wondered what it was that he could be thinking about, while he)Tj
T*(kept silence, but was evidently observing, with an interest that)Tj
T*(was slightly sarcastic, all that Edith and she were doing. The)Tj
T*(sarcastic feeling was called out by Mrs. Shaw's conversation with)Tj
T*(his brother; it was separate from the interest which was excited)Tj
T*(by what he saw. He thought it a pretty sight to see the two)Tj
T*(cousins so busy in their little arrangements about the table.)Tj
T*(Edith chose to do most herself. She was in a humour to enjoy)Tj
T*(showing her lover how well she could behave as a soldier's wife.)Tj
T*(She found out that the water in the urn was cold, and ordered up)Tj
T*(the great kitchen tea-kettle; the only consequence of which was)Tj
T*(that when she met it at the door, and tried to carry it in, it)Tj
T*(was too heavy for her, and she came in pouting, with a black mark)Tj
T*(on her muslin gown, and a little round white hand indented by the)Tj
T*(handle, which she took to show to Captain Lennox, just like a)Tj
T*(hurt child, and, of course, the remedy was the same in both)Tj
T*(cases. Margaret's quickly-adjusted spirit-lamp was the most)Tj
T*(efficacious contrivance, though not so like the gypsy-encampment)Tj

T*(Margaret was once more in her morning dress, travelling quietly)Tj
T*(home with her father, who had come up to assist at the wedding.)Tj
T*(Her mother had been detained at home by a multitude of)Tj
T*(half-reasons, none of which anybody fully understood, except Mr.)Tj
T*(Hale, who was perfectly aware that all his arguments in favour of)Tj
T*(a grey satin gown, which was midway between oldness and newness,)Tj
T*(had proved unavailing; and that, as he had not the money to equip)Tj
T*(his wife afresh, from top to toe, she would not show herself at)Tj
T*(her only sister's only child's wedding. If Mrs. Shaw had guessed)Tj
T*(at the real reason why Mrs. Hale did not accompany her husband,)Tj
T*(she would have showered down gowns upon her; but it was nearly)Tj
T*(twenty years since Mrs. Shaw had been the poor, pretty Miss)Tj
T*(Beresford, and she had really forgotten all grievances except)Tj
T*(that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married)Tj
T*(life, on which she could descant by the half-hour. Dearest Maria)Tj
T*(had married the man of her heart, only eight years older than)Tj
T*(herself, with the sweetest temper, and that blue-black hair one)Tj
T*(so seldom sees. Mr. Hale was one of the most delightful preachers)Tj
T*(she had ever heard, and a perfect model of a parish priest.)Tj
T*(Perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all these)Tj
T*(premises, but it was still Mrs. Shaw's characteristic conclusion,)Tj
T*(as she thought over her sister's lot: 'Married for love, what can)Tj
T*(dearest Maria have to wish for in this world?' Mrs. Hale, if she)Tj
T*(spoke truth, might have answered with a ready-made list, 'a)Tj
T*(silver-grey glace silk, a white chip bonnet, oh! dozens of things)Tj
T*(for the wedding, and hundreds of things for the house.' Margaret)Tj
T*(only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come,)Tj
T*(and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and greeting)Tj
T*(would take place at Helstone parsonage, rather than, during the)Tj
T*(confusion of the last two or three days, in the house in Harley)Tj
T*(Street, where she herself had had to play the part of Figaro, and)Tj
T*(was wanted everywhere at one and the same time. Her mind and body)Tj
T*(ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said)Tj
T*(within the last forty-eight hours. The farewells so hurriedly)Tj
T*(taken, amongst all the other good-byes, of those she had lived)Tj
T*(with so long, oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times)Tj
T*(that were no more; it did not signify what those times had been,)Tj
T*(they were gone never to return. Margaret's heart felt more heavy)Tj
T*(than she could ever have thought it possible in going to her own)Tj
T*(dear home, the place and the life she had longed for for)Tj
T*(years--at that time of all times for yearning and longing, just)Tj
T*(before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep. She took)Tj
T*(her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to)Tj
T*(the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future. Her eyes)Tj
T*(began to see, not visions of what had been, but the sight)Tj
T*(actually before her; her dear father leaning back asleep in the)Tj
T*(railway carriage. His blue-black hair was grey now, and lay)Tj
T*(thinly over his brows. The bones of his face were plainly to be)Tj
T*(seen--too plainly for beauty, if his features had been less)Tj
T*(finely cut; as it was, they had a grace if not a comeliness of)Tj
T*(their own. The face was in repose; but it was rather rest after)Tj
T*(weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led)Tj
T*(a placid, contented life. Margaret was painfully struck by the)Tj
T*(worn, anxious expression; and she went back over the open and)Tj
T*(avowed circumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for)Tj
T*(the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and)Tj
T*(depression.)Tj

T*('Poor Frederick!' thought she, sighing. 'Oh! if Frederick had but)Tj

T*(to us all! I wish I knew all about it. I never understood it from)Tj
T*(Aunt Shaw; I only knew he could not come back to England because)Tj
T*(of that terrible affair. Poor dear papa! how sad he looks! I am)Tj
T*(so glad I am going home, to be at hand to comfort him and mamma.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She was ready with a bright smile, in which there was not a trace)Tj
T*(of fatigue, to greet her father when he awakened. He smiled back)Tj
T*(again, but faintly, as if it were an unusual exertion. His face)Tj
T*(returned into its lines of habitual anxiety. He had a trick of)Tj
T*(half-opening his mouth as if to speak, which constantly unsettled)Tj
T*(the form of the lips, and gave the face an undecided expression.)Tj
T*(But he had the same large, soft eyes as his daughter,--eyes which)Tj
T*(moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits, and were)Tj
T*(well veiled by their transparent white eyelids. Margaret was more)Tj
T*(like him than like her mother. Sometimes people wondered that)Tj
T*(parents so handsome should have a daughter who was so far from)Tj
T*(regularly beautiful; not beautiful at all, was occasionally said.)Tj
T*(Her mouth was wide; no rosebud that could only open just' enough)Tj
T*(to let out a 'yes' and 'no,' and 'an't please you, sir.' But the)Tj
T*(wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips; and the skin, if)Tj
T*(not white and fair, was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy. If)Tj
T*(the look on her face was, in general, too dignified and reserved)Tj
T*(for one so young, now, talking to her father, it was bright as)Tj
T*(the morning,--full of dimples, and glances that spoke of childish)Tj
T*(gladness, and boundless hope in the future.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It was the latter part of July when Margaret returned home. The)Tj
T*(forest trees were all one dark, full, dusky green; the fern below)Tj
T*(them caught all the slanting sunbeams; the weather was sultry and)Tj
T*(broodingly still. Margaret used to tramp along by her father's)Tj
T*(side, crushing down the fern with a cruel glee, as she felt it)Tj
T*(yield under her light foot, and send up the fragrance peculiar to)Tj
T*(it,--out on the broad commons into the warm scented light, seeing)Tj
T*(multitudes of wild, free, living creatures, revelling in the)Tj
T*(sunshine, and the herbs and flowers it called forth. This)Tj
T*(life--at least these walks--realised all Margaret's)Tj
T*(anticipations. She took a pride in her forest. Its people were)Tj
T*(her people. She made hearty friends with them; learned and)Tj
T*(delighted in using their peculiar words; took up her freedom)Tj
T*(amongst them; nursed their babies; talked or read with slow)Tj
T*(distinctness to their old people; carried dainty messes to their)Tj
T*(sick; resolved before long to teach at the school, where her)Tj
T*(father went every day as to an appointed task, but she was)Tj
T*(continually tempted off to go and see some individual)Tj
T*(friend--man, woman, or child--in some cottage in the green shade)Tj
T*(of the forest. Her out-of-doors life was perfect. Her in-doors)Tj
T*(life had its drawbacks. With the healthy shame of a child, she)Tj
T*(blamed herself for her keenness of sight, in perceiving that all)Tj
T*(was not as it should be there. Her mother--her mother always so)Tj
T*(kind and tender towards her--seemed now and then so much)Tj
T*(discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop)Tj
T*(strangely neglected his episcopal duties, in not giving Mr. Hale)Tj
T*(a better living; and almost reproached her husband because he)Tj
T*(could not bring himself to say that he wished to leave the)Tj
T*(parish, and undertake the charge of a larger. He would sigh aloud)Tj

T*(urgency of his wife, that he would put himself in the way of)Tj
T*(seeking some preferment, Margaret saw that her father shrank more)Tj
T*(and more; and she strove at such times to reconcile her mother to)Tj
T*(Helstone. Mrs. Hale said that the near neighbourhood of so many)Tj
T*(trees affected her health; and Margaret would try to tempt her)Tj
T*(forth on to the beautiful, broad, upland, sun-streaked,)Tj
T*(cloud-shadowed common; for she was sure that her mother had)Tj
T*(accustomed herself too much to an in-doors life, seldom extending)Tj
T*(her walks beyond the church, the school, and the neighbouring)Tj
T*(cottages. This did good for a time; but when the autumn drew on,)Tj
T*(and the weather became more changeable, her mother's idea of the)Tj
T*(unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even more)Tj
T*(frequently that her husband, who was more learned than Mr. Hume,)Tj
T*(a better parish priest than Mr. Houldsworth, should not have met)Tj
T*(with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs)Tj
T*(had done.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent,)Tj
T*(was what Margaret was unprepared for. She knew, and had rather)Tj
T*(revelled in the idea, that she should have to give up many)Tj
T*(luxuries, which had only been troubles and trammels to her)Tj
T*(freedom in Harley Street. Her keen enjoyment of every sensuous)Tj
T*(pleasure, was balanced finely, if not overbalanced, by her)Tj
T*(conscious pride in being able to do without them all, if need)Tj
T*(were. But the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon)Tj
T*(from which we watch for it. There had been slight complaints and)Tj
T*(passing regrets on her mother's part, over some trifle connected)Tj
T*(with Helstone, and her father's position there, when Margaret had)Tj
T*(been spending her holidays at home before; but in the general)Tj
T*(happiness of the recollection of those times, she had forgotten)Tj
T*(the small details which were not so pleasant. In the latter half)Tj
T*(of September, the autumnal rains and storms came on, and Margaret)Tj
T*(was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto)Tj
T*(done. Helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their)Tj
T*(own standard of cultivation.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is undoubtedly one of the most out-of-the-way places in)Tj
T*(England,' said Mrs. Hale, in one of her plaintive moods. 'I can't)Tj

T*(farmers and labourers from week's end to week's end. If we only)Tj

T*(tired I used to be of the drives every day in Aunt Shaw's)Tj
T*(carriage, and how I longed to walk!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(And walk Margaret did, in spite of the weather. She was so happy)Tj
T*(out of doors, at her father's side, that she almost danced; and)Tj
T*(with the soft violence of the west wind behind her, as she)Tj
T*(crossed some heath, she seemed to be borne onwards, as lightly)Tj
T*(and easily as the fallen leaf that was wafted along by the)Tj
T*(autumnal breeze. But the evenings were rather difficult to fill)Tj
T*(up agreeably. Immediately after tea her father withdrew into his)Tj
T*(small library, and she and her mother were left alone. Mrs. Hale)Tj
T*(had never cared much for books, and had discouraged her husband,)Tj
T*(very early in their married life, in his desire of reading aloud)Tj
T*(to her, while she worked. At one time they had tried backgammon)Tj
T*(as a resource; but as Mr. Hale grew to take an increasing)Tj
T*(interest in his school and his parishioners, he found that the)Tj
T*(interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as)Tj
T*(hardships by his wife, not to be accepted as the natural)Tj
T*(conditions of his profession, but to be regretted and struggled)Tj
T*(against by her as they severally arose. So he withdrew, while the)Tj
T*(children were yet young, into his library, to spend his evenings)Tj
T*(\(if he were at home\), in reading the speculative and metaphysical)Tj
T*(books which were his delight.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When Margaret had been here before, she had brought down with her)Tj
T*(a great box of books, recommended by masters or governess, and)Tj
T*(had found the summer's day all too short to get through the)Tj
T*(reading she had to do before her return to town. Now there were)Tj
T*(only the well-bound little-read English Classics, which were)Tj
T*(weeded out of her father's library to fill up the small)Tj
T*(book-shelves in the drawing-room. Thomson's Seasons, Hayley's)Tj
T*(Cowper, Middleton's Cicero, were by far the lightest, newest, and)Tj
T*(most amusing. The book-shelves did not afford much resource.)Tj
T*(Margaret told her mother every particular of her London life, to)Tj
T*(all of which Mrs. Hale listened with interest, sometimes amused)Tj
T*(and questioning, at others a little inclined to compare her)Tj
T*(sister's circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower)Tj
T*(means at Helstone vicarage. On such evenings Margaret was apt to)Tj
T*(stop talking rather abruptly, and listen to the drip-drip of the)Tj
T*(rain upon the leads of the little bow-window. Once or twice)Tj
T*(Margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition of)Tj
T*(the monotonous sound, while she wondered if she might venture to)Tj
T*(put a question on a subject very near to her heart, and ask where)Tj
T*(Frederick was now; what he was doing; how long it was since they)Tj
T*(had heard from him. But a consciousness that her mother's)Tj
T*(delicate health, and positive dislike to Helstone, all dated from)Tj
T*(the time of the mutiny in which Frederick had been engaged,--the)Tj
T*(full account of which Margaret had never heard, and which now)Tj
T*(seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivion,--made her pause and)Tj
T*(turn away from the subject each time she approached it. When she)Tj
T*(was with her mother, her father seemed the best person to apply)Tj

T*(before leaving Harley Street, her father had told her that they)Tj
T*(had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and very well in)Tj
T*(health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones, but)Tj
T*(not the living intelligence she longed for. Frederick was always)Tj
T*(spoken of, in the rare times when his name was mentioned, as)Tj
T*('Poor Frederick.' His room was kept exactly as he had left it;)Tj
T*(and was regularly dusted, and put into order by Dixon, Mrs.)Tj
T*(Hale's maid, who touched no other part of the household work, but)Tj
T*(always remembered the day when she had been engaged by Lady)Tj
T*(Beresford as ladies' maid to Sir John's wards, the pretty Miss)Tj
T*(Beresfords, the belles of Rutlandshire. Dixon had always)Tj
T*(considered Mr. Hale as the blight which had fallen upon her young)Tj
T*(lady's prospects in life. If Miss Beresford had not been in such)Tj
T*(a hurry to marry a poor country clergyman, there was no knowing)Tj
T*(what she might not have become. But Dixon was too loyal to desert)Tj
T*(her in her affliction and downfall \(alias her married life\). She)Tj
T*(remained with her, and was devoted to her interests; always)Tj
T*(considering herself as the good and protecting fairy, whose duty)Tj
T*(it was to baffle the malignant giant, Mr. Hale. Master Frederick)Tj
T*(had been her favorite and pride; and it was with a little)Tj
T*(softening of her dignified look and manner, that she went in)Tj
T*(weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be)Tj
T*(coming home that very evening. Margaret could not help believing)Tj
T*(that there had been some late intelligence of Frederick, unknown)Tj
T*(to her mother, which was making her father anxious and uneasy.)Tj
T*(Mrs. Hale did not seem to perceive any alteration in her)Tj
T*(husband's looks or ways. His spirits were always tender and)Tj
T*(gentle, readily affected by any small piece of intelligence)Tj
T*(concerning the welfare of others. He would be depressed for many)Tj
T*(days after witnessing a death-bed, or hearing of any crime. But)Tj
T*(now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts were)Tj
T*(pre-occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not)Tj
T*(be relieved by any daily action, such as comforting the)Tj
T*(survivors, or teaching at the school in hope of lessening the)Tj
T*(evils in the generation to come. Mr. Hale did not go out among)Tj
T*(his parishioners as much as usual; he was more shut up in his)Tj
T*(study; was anxious for the village postman, whose summons to the)Tj
T*(house-hold was a rap on the back-kitchen window-shutter--a signal)Tj
T*(which at one time had often to be repeated before any one was)Tj
T*(sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to understand what it)Tj
T*(was, and attend to him. Now Mr. Hale loitered about the garden if)Tj
T*(the morning was fine, and if not, stood dreamily by the study)Tj
T*(window until the postman had called, or gone down the lane,)Tj
T*(giving a half-respectful, half-confidential shake of the head to)Tj
T*(the parson, who watched him away beyond the sweet-briar hedge,)Tj
T*(and past the great arbutus, before he turned into the room to)Tj
T*(begin his day's work, with all the signs of a heavy heart and an)Tj
T*(occupied mind.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But Margaret was at an age when any apprehension, not absolutely)Tj
T*(based on a knowledge of facts, is easily banished for a time by a)Tj
T*(bright sunny day, or some happy outward circumstance. And when)Tj
T*(the brilliant fourteen fine days of October came on, her cares)Tj
T*(were all blown away as lightly as thistledown, and she thought of)Tj
T*(nothing but the glories of the forest. The fern-harvest was over,)Tj
T*(and now that the rain was gone, many a deep glade was accessible,)Tj
T*(into which Margaret had only peeped in July and August weather.)Tj
T*(She had learnt drawing with Edith; and she had sufficiently)Tj
T*(regretted, during the gloom of the bad weather, her idle)Tj
T*(revelling in the beauty of the woodlands while it had yet been)Tj

T*('Mr. Henry Lennox.' Margaret had been thinking of him only a)Tj

T*(occupations at home. It was 'parler du soleil et l'on en voit les)Tj
T*(rayons;' and the brightness of the sun came over Margaret's face)Tj
T*(as she put down her board, and went forward to shake hands with)Tj
T*(him. 'Tell mamma, Sarah,' said she. 'Mamma and I want to ask you)Tj
T*(so many questions about Edith; I am so much obliged to you for)Tj

T*(mountain, sailing on that lake, that I really thought they needed)Tj
T*(a Mentor to take care of them. And indeed they did; they were)Tj
T*(quite beyond my uncle's management, and kept the old gentleman in)Tj
T*(a panic for sixteen hours out of the twenty-four. Indeed, when I)Tj

T*(When she had left the room, he began in his scrutinising way to)Tj
T*(look about him. The little drawing-room was looking its best in)Tj
T*(the streaming light of the morning sun. The middle window in the)Tj
T*(bow was opened, and clustering roses and the scarlet honeysuckle)Tj
T*(came peeping round the corner; the small lawn was gorgeous with)Tj
T*(verbenas and geraniums of all bright colours. But the very)Tj
T*(brightness outside made the colours within seem poor and faded.)Tj
T*(The carpet was far from new; the chintz had been often washed;)Tj
T*(the whole apartment was smaller and shabbier than he had)Tj
T*(expected, as back-ground and frame-work for Margaret, herself so)Tj
T*(queenly. He took up one of the books lying on the table; it was)Tj
T*(the Paradiso of Dante, in the proper old Italian binding of white)Tj
T*(vellum and gold; by it lay a dictionary, and some words copied)Tj
T*(out in Margaret's hand-writing. They were a dull list of words,)Tj
T*(but somehow he liked looking at them. He put them down with a)Tj
T*(sigh.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The living is evidently as small as she said. It seems strange,)Tj
T*(for the Beresfords belong to a good family.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret meanwhile had found her mother. It was one of Mrs.)Tj
T*(Hale's fitful days, when everything was a difficulty and a)Tj
T*(hardship; and Mr. Lennox's appearance took this shape, although)Tj
T*(secretly she felt complimented by his thinking it worth while to)Tj
T*(call.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is most unfortunate! We are dining early to-day, and having)Tj
T*(nothing but cold meat, in order that the servants may get on with)Tj
T*(their ironing; and yet, of course, we must ask him to)Tj
T*(dinner--Edith's brother-in-law and all. And your papa is in such)Tj
T*(low spirits this morning about something--I don't know what. I)Tj
T*(went into the study just now, and he had his face on the table,)Tj
T*(covering it with his hands. I told him I was sure Helstone air)Tj
T*(did not agree with him any more than with me, and he suddenly)Tj
T*(lifted up his head, and begged me not to speak a word more)Tj
T*(against Helstone, he could not bear it; if there was one place he)Tj
T*(loved on earth it was Helstone. But I am sure, for all that, it)Tj
T*(is the damp and relaxing air.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret felt as if a thin cold cloud had come between her and)Tj
T*(the sun. She had listened patiently, in hopes that it might be)Tj
T*(some relief to her mother to unburden herself; but now it was)Tj
T*(time to draw her back to Mr. Lennox.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Papa likes Mr. Lennox; they got on together famously at the)Tj
T*(wedding breakfast. I dare say his coming will do papa good. And)Tj
T*(never mind the dinner, dear mamma. Cold meat will do capitally)Tj
T*(for a lunch, which is the light in which Mr. Lennox will most)Tj
T*(likely look upon a two o'clock dinner.')Tj

T*(that will take him out of your way, mamma. Only do come in now;)Tj
T*(he will think it so strange if you don't.')Tj

T*(Mrs. Hale took off her black silk apron, and smoothed her face.)Tj
T*(She looked a very pretty lady-like woman, as she greeted Mr.)Tj

T*(He evidently expected to be asked to spend the day, and accepted)Tj
T*(the invitation with a glad readiness that made Mrs. Hale wish she)Tj
T*(could add something to the cold beef. He was pleased with)Tj
T*(everything; delighted with Margaret's idea of going out sketching)Tj
T*(together; would not have Mr. Hale disturbed for the world, with)Tj
T*(the prospect of so soon meeting him at dinner. Margaret brought)Tj
T*(out her drawing materials for him to choose from; and after the)Tj
T*(paper and brushes had been duly selected, the two set out in the)Tj
T*(merriest spirits in the world.)Tj

T*('Oh! You might have come straight from chambers in the Temple,')Tj
T*(instead of having been two months in the Highlands! Look at this)Tj
T*(beautiful trunk of a tree, which the wood-cutters have left just)Tj

T*(these cottages?')Tj

T*(uninhabited; the foresters are going to take it down, as soon as)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The old man stood bareheaded in the sun, leaning on his stick at)Tj
T*(the front of his cottage. His stiff features relaxed into a slow)Tj
T*(smile as Margaret went up and spoke to him. Mr. Lennox hastily)Tj
T*(introduced the two figures into his sketch, and finished up the)Tj

T*(presented by a neighbour. Mr. Hale had returned from his)Tj
T*(morning's round, and was awaiting his visitor just outside the)Tj
T*(wicket gate that led into the garden. He looked a complete)Tj
T*(gentleman in his rather threadbare coat and well-worn hat.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret was proud of her father; she had always a fresh and)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hale asked to look at their sketches.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I think you have made the tints on the thatch too dark, have you)Tj

T*(Mr. Lennox's, which was withheld from him one moment, no more.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, papa! I don't think I have. The house-leek and stone-crop)Tj
T*(have grown so much darker in the rain. Is it not like, papa?')Tj
T*(said she, peeping over his shoulder, as he looked at the figures)Tj
T*(in Mr. Lennox's drawing.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, very like. Your figure and way of holding yourself is)Tj
T*(capital. And it is just poor old Isaac's stiff way of stooping)Tj
T*(his long rheumatic back. What is this hanging from the branch of)Tj
T*(the tree? Not a bird's nest, surely.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh no! that is my bonnet. I never can draw with my bonnet on; it)Tj

T*(are so many people about here whom I should like to sketch.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I should say that a likeness you very much wish to take you)Tj
T*(would always succeed in,' said Mr. Lennox. 'I have great faith in)Tj
T*(the power of will. I think myself I have succeeded pretty well in)Tj
T*(yours.' Mr. Hale had preceded them into the house, while Margaret)Tj
T*(was lingering to pluck some roses, with which to adorn her)Tj
T*(morning gown for dinner.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A regular London girl would understand the implied meaning of)Tj
T*(that speech,' thought Mr. Lennox. 'She would be up to looking)Tj
T*(through every speech that a young man made her for the)Tj
T*(arriere-pensee of a compliment. But I don't believe Margaret,--Stay!')Tj
T*(exclaimed he, 'Let me help you;' and he gathered for her some velvety)Tj
T*(cramoisy roses that were above her reach, and then dividing the)Tj

T*(The conversation at dinner flowed on quietly and agreeably. There)Tj

T*(neighbourhood of Margaret, Mr. Lennox forgot the little feeling)Tj
T*(of disappointment with which he had at first perceived that she)Tj
T*(had spoken but the simple truth when she had described her)Tj
T*(father's living as very small.)Tj

T*(Mrs. Hale was hurried. It seemed as if desserts were impromptu)Tj
T*(and unusual things at the parsonage; whereas, if Mr. Hale would)Tj
T*(only have looked behind him, he would have seen biscuits and)Tj
T*(marmalade, and what not, all arranged in formal order on the)Tj

T*(as she and Dixon had got out the finger-glasses from the)Tj
T*(store-room on purpose to be as correct as became General Shaw's)Tj
T*(widow's sister, but as Mr. Hale got up directly, and prepared to)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I shall arm myself with a knife,' said Mr. Hale: 'the days of)Tj
T*(eating fruit so primitively as you describe are over with me. I)Tj
T*(must pare it and quarter it before I can enjoy it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret made a plate for the pears out of a beetroot leaf, which)Tj
T*(threw up their brown gold colour admirably. Mr. Lennox looked)Tj
T*(more at her than at the pears; but her father, inclined to cull)Tj
T*(fastidiously the very zest and perfection of the hour he had)Tj
T*(stolen from his anxiety, chose daintily the ripest fruit, and sat)Tj
T*(down on the garden bench to enjoy it at his leisure. Margaret and)Tj
T*(Mr. Lennox strolled along the little terrace-walk under the south)Tj
T*(wall, where the bees still hummed and worked busily in their)Tj

T*('What a perfect life you seem to live here! I have always felt)Tj

T*(bitterness of disappointment which would have been stamped on her)Tj

T*(Her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was)Tj
T*(adjusted into anything like order. Margaret had to shake off the)Tj
T*(recollections of what had been done and said through the day, and)Tj
T*(turn a sympathising listener to the account of how Dixon had)Tj
T*(complained that the ironing-blanket had been burnt again; and how)Tj
T*(Susan Lightfoot had been seen with artificial flowers in her)Tj
T*(bonnet, thereby giving evidence of a vain and giddy character.)Tj
T*(Mr. Hale sipped his tea in abstracted silence; Margaret had the)Tj
T*(responses all to herself. She wondered how her father and mother)Tj
T*(could be so forgetful, so regardless of their companion through)Tj
T*(the day, as never to mention his name. She forgot that he had not)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(After tea Mr. Hale got up, and stood with his elbow on the)Tj

T*(out to consult with Dixon about some winter clothing for the)Tj

T*(rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening, and)Tj
T*(wishing bed-time were come that she might go over the events of)Tj

T*('Very serious to us all.' Mr. Lennox had never had the)Tj
T*(opportunity of having any private conversation with her father)Tj
T*(after her refusal, or else that would indeed be a very serious)Tj
T*(affair. In the first place, Margaret felt guilty and ashamed of)Tj
T*(having grown so much into a woman as to be thought of in)Tj
T*(marriage; and secondly, she did not know if her father might not)Tj
T*(be displeased that she had taken upon herself to decline Mr.)Tj
T*(Lennox's proposal. But she soon felt it was not about anything,)Tj
T*(which having only lately and suddenly occurred, could have given)Tj

T*(became more than I could bear without speaking, I wrote to Mr.)Tj
T*(Bell--you remember Mr. Bell, Margaret?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No; I never saw him, I think. But I know who he is. Frederick's)Tj
T*(godfather--your old tutor at Oxford, don't you mean?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes. He is a Fellow of Plymouth College there. He is a native of)Tj
T*(Milton-Northern, I believe. At any rate, he has property there,)Tj
T*(which has very much increased in value since Milton has become)Tj
T*(such a large manufacturing town. Well, I had reason to)Tj
T*(suspect--to imagine--I had better say nothing about it, however.)Tj
T*(But I felt sure of sympathy from Mr. Bell. I don't know that he)Tj
T*(gave me much strength. He has lived an easy life in his college)Tj
T*(all his days. But he has been as kind as can be. And it is owing)Tj
T*(to him we are going to Milton.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How?' said Margaret.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why he has tenants, and houses, and mills there; so, though he)Tj
T*(dislikes the place--too bustling for one of his habits--he is)Tj
T*(obliged to keep up some sort of connection; and he tells me that)Tj
T*(he hears there is a good opening for a private tutor there.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A private tutor!' said Margaret, looking scornful: 'What in the)Tj
T*(world do manufacturers want with the classics, or literature, or)Tj
T*(the accomplishments of a gentleman?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh,' said her father, 'some of them really seem to be fine)Tj
T*(fellows, conscious of their own deficiencies, which is more than)Tj
T*(many a man at Oxford is. Some want resolutely to learn, though)Tj
T*(they have come to man's estate. Some want their children to be)Tj
T*(better instructed than they themselves have been. At any rate,)Tj
T*(there is an opening, as I have said, for a private tutor. Mr.)Tj
T*(Bell has recommended me to a Mr. Thornton, a tenant of his, and a)Tj
T*(very intelligent man, as far as I can judge from his letters. And)Tj
T*(in Milton, Margaret, I shall find a busy life, if not a happy)Tj
T*(one, and people and scenes so different that I shall never be)Tj
T*(reminded of Helstone.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There was the secret motive, as Margaret knew from her own)Tj
T*(feelings. It would be different. Discordant as it was--with)Tj
T*(almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the North of)Tj
T*(England, the manufacturers, the people, the wild and bleak)Tj
T*(country--there was this one recommendation--it would be different)Tj
T*(from Helstone, and could never remind them of that beloved place.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('When do we go?' asked Margaret, after a short silence.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I do not know exactly. I wanted to talk it over with you. You)Tj
T*(see, your mother knows nothing about it yet: but I think, in a)Tj
T*(fortnight;--after my deed of resignation is sent in, I shall have)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('In a fortnight!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No--no, not exactly to a day. Nothing is fixed,' said her)Tj
T*(father, with anxious hesitation, as he noticed the filmy sorrow)Tj
T*(that came over her eyes, and the sudden change in her complexion.)Tj
T*(But she recovered herself immediately.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, papa, it had better be fixed soon and decidedly, as you)Tj

T*(delusion--some temptation! You do not really mean it!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Then he looked her in the face, and said in a slow, hoarse,)Tj
T*(measured way--'I do mean it, Margaret. You must not deceive)Tj
T*(yourself into doubting the reality of my words--my fixed)Tj
T*(intention and resolve.' He looked at her in the same steady,)Tj
T*(stony manner, for some moments after he had done speaking. She,)Tj
T*(too, gazed back with pleading eyes before she would believe that)Tj
T*(it was irrevocable. Then she arose and went, without another word)Tj
T*(or look, towards the door. As her fingers were on the handle he)Tj
T*(called her back. He was standing by the fireplace, shrunk and)Tj
T*(stooping; but as she came near he drew himself up to his full)Tj
T*(height, and, placing his hands on her head, he said, solemnly:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The blessing of God be upon thee, my child!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And may He restore you to His Church,' responded she, out of the)Tj
T*(fulness of her heart. The next moment she feared lest this answer)Tj
T*(to his blessing might be irreverent, wrong--might hurt him as)Tj
T*(coming from his daughter, and she threw her arms round his neck.)Tj
T*(He held her to him for a minute or two. She heard him murmur to)Tj
T*(himself, 'The martyrs and confessors had even more pain to)Tj
T*(bear--I will not shrink.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They were startled by hearing Mrs. Hale inquiring for her)Tj
T*(daughter. They started asunder in the full consciousness of all)Tj
T*(that was before them. Mr. Hale hurriedly said--'Go, Margaret, go.)Tj

T*(Margaret made a good listener to all her mother's little plans)Tj
T*(for adding some small comforts to the lot of the poorer)Tj
T*(parishioners. She could not help listening, though each new)Tj
T*(project was a stab to her heart. By the time the frost had set)Tj
T*(in, they should be far away from Helstone. Old Simon's rheumatism)Tj
T*(might be bad and his eyesight worse; there would be no one to go)Tj
T*(and read to him, and comfort him with little porringers of broth)Tj
T*(and good red flannel: or if there was, it would be a stranger,)Tj
T*(and the old man would watch in vain for her. Mary Domville's)Tj
T*(little crippled boy would crawl in vain to the door and look for)Tj
T*(her coming through the forest. These poor friends would never)Tj
T*(understand why she had forsaken them; and there were many others)Tj
T*(besides. 'Papa has always spent the income he derived from his)Tj
T*(living in the parish. I am, perhaps, encroaching upon the next)Tj
T*(dues, but the winter is likely to be severe, and our poor old)Tj
T*(people must be helped.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, mamma, let us do all we can,' said Margaret eagerly, not)Tj
T*(seeing the prudential side of the question, only grasping at the)Tj
T*(idea that they were rendering such help for the last time; 'we)Tj
T*(may not be here long.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Do you feel ill, my darling?' asked Mrs. Hale, anxiously,)Tj
T*(misunderstanding Margaret's hint of the uncertainty of their stay)Tj
T*(at Helstone. 'You look pale and tired. It is this soft, damp,)Tj
T*(unhealthy air.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No--no, mamma, it is not that: it is delicious air. It smells of)Tj
T*(the freshest, purest fragrance, after the smokiness of Harley)Tj
T*(Street. But I am tired: it surely must be near bedtime.')Tj

T*(she must make no noise. She went and curled herself up on the)Tj
T*(window-seat in the small, deeply-recessed window. That morning)Tj
T*(when she had looked out, her heart had danced at seeing the)Tj
T*(bright clear lights on the church tower, which foretold a fine)Tj
T*(and sunny day. This evening--sixteen hours at most had past)Tj
T*(by--she sat down, too full of sorrow to cry, but with a dull cold)Tj
T*(pain, which seemed to have pressed the youth and buoyancy out of)Tj
T*(her heart, never to return. Mr. Henry Lennox's visit--his)Tj
T*(offer--was like a dream, a thing beside her actual life. The hard)Tj
T*(reality was, that her father had so admitted tempting doubts into)Tj
T*(his mind as to become a schismatic--an outcast; all the changes)Tj
T*(consequent upon this grouped themselves around that one great)Tj
T*(blighting fact.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She looked out upon the dark-gray lines of the church tower,)Tj
T*(square and straight in the centre of the view, cutting against)Tj
T*(the deep blue transparent depths beyond, into which she gazed,)Tj
T*(and felt that she might gaze for ever, seeing at every moment)Tj
T*(some farther distance, and yet no sign of God! It seemed to her)Tj
T*(at the moment, as if the earth was more utterly desolate than if)Tj
T*(girt in by an iron dome, behind which there might be the)Tj
T*(ineffaceable peace and glory of the Almighty: those never-ending)Tj
T*(depths of space, in their still serenity, were more mocking to)Tj
T*(her than any material bounds could be--shutting in the cries of)Tj
T*(earth's sufferers, which now might ascend into that infinite)Tj
T*(splendour of vastness and be lost--lost for ever, before they)Tj
T*(reached His throne. In this mood her father came in unheard. The)Tj
T*(moonlight was strong enough to let him see his daughter in her)Tj
T*(unusual place and attitude. He came to her and touched her)Tj
T*(shoulder before she was aware that he was there.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Margaret, I heard you were up. I could not help coming in to ask)Tj
T*(you to pray with me--to say the Lord's Prayer; that will do good)Tj
T*(to both of us.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hale and Margaret knelt by the window-seat--he looking up,)Tj
T*(she bowed down in humble shame. God was there, close around them,)Tj
T*(hearing her father's whispered words. Her father might be a)Tj
T*(heretic; but had not she, in her despairing doubts not five)Tj
T*(minutes before, shown herself a far more utter sceptic? She spoke)Tj
T*(not a word, but stole to bed after her father had left her, like)Tj
T*(a child ashamed of its fault. If the world was full of perplexing)Tj
T*(problems she would trust, and only ask to see the one step)Tj
T*(needful for the hour. Mr. Lennox--his visit, his proposal--the)Tj
T*(remembrance of which had been so rudely pushed aside by the)Tj
T*(subsequent events of the day--haunted her dreams that night. He)Tj
T*(was climbing up some tree of fabulous height to reach the branch)Tj
T*(whereon was slung her bonnet: he was falling, and she was)Tj
T*(struggling to save him, but held back by some invisible powerful)Tj
T*(hand. He was dead. And yet, with a shifting of the scene, she was)Tj
T*(once more in the Harley Street drawing-room, talking to him as of)Tj
T*(old, and still with a consciousness all the time that she had)Tj
T*(seen him killed by that terrible fall.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Miserable, unresting night! Ill preparation for the coming day!)Tj
T*(She awoke with a start, unrefreshed, and conscious of some)Tj
T*(reality worse even than her feverish dreams. It all came back)Tj
T*(upon her; not merely the sorrow, but the terrible discord in the)Tj
T*(sorrow. Where, to what distance apart, had her father wandered,)Tj

T*(The fine Crisp morning made her mother feel particularly well and)Tj
T*(happy at breakfast-time. She talked on, planning village)Tj
T*(kindnesses, unheeding the silence of her husband and the)Tj
T*(monosyllabic answers of Margaret. Before the things were cleared)Tj

T*('I shall not be at home till evening. I am going to Bracy Common,)Tj

T*(in shadow, as the latter stood holding the candle a little behind)Tj
T*(her, for fear of the effect on Miss Hale's startled eyes, swollen)Tj
T*(and blinded as they were.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, Dixon! I did not hear you come into the room!' said)Tj
T*(Margaret, resuming her trembling self-restraint. 'Is it very)Tj
T*(late?' continued she, lifting herself languidly off the bed, yet)Tj
T*(letting her feet touch the ground without fairly standing down,)Tj
T*(as she shaded her wet ruffled hair off her face, and tried to)Tj
T*(look as though nothing were the matter; as if she had only been)Tj
T*(asleep.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I hardly can tell what time it is,' replied Dixon, in an)Tj
T*(aggrieved tone of voice. 'Since your mamma told me this terrible)Tj
T*(news, when I dressed her for tea, I've lost all count of time.)Tj
T*(I'm sure I don't know what is to become of us all. When Charlotte)Tj
T*(told me just now you were sobbing, Miss Hale, I thought, no)Tj
T*(wonder, poor thing! And master thinking of turning Dissenter at)Tj
T*(his time of life, when, if it is not to be said he's done well in)Tj
T*(the Church, he's not done badly after all. I had a cousin, miss,)Tj
T*(who turned Methodist preacher after he was fifty years of age,)Tj
T*(and a tailor all his life; but then he had never been able to)Tj
T*(make a pair of trousers to fit, for as long as he had been in the)Tj
T*(trade, so it was no wonder; but for master! as I said to missus,)Tj
T*("What would poor Sir John have said? he never liked your marrying)Tj
T*(Mr. Hale, but if he could have known it would have come to this,)Tj
T*(he would have sworn worse oaths than ever, if that was)Tj
T*(possible!"')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Dixon had been so much accustomed to comment upon Mr. Hale's)Tj
T*(proceedings to her mistress \(who listened to her, or not, as she)Tj
T*(was in the humour\), that she never noticed Margaret's flashing)Tj
T*(eye and dilating nostril. To hear her father talked of in this)Tj

T*(Dixon hung irresolutely about the room for a minute or two.)Tj
T*(Margaret repeated, 'You may leave me, Dixon. I wish you to go.')Tj
T*(Dixon did not know whether to resent these decided words or to)Tj
T*(cry; either course would have done with her mistress: but, as she)Tj
T*(said to herself, 'Miss Margaret has a touch of the old gentleman)Tj
T*(about her, as well as poor Master Frederick; I wonder where they)Tj

T*('Mayn't I unfasten your gown, miss, and do your hair?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No! not to-night, thank you.' And Margaret gravely lighted her)Tj

T*(many others, liked to feel herself ruled by a powerful and)Tj
T*(decided nature.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret needed all Dixon's help in action, and silence in words;)Tj
T*(for, for some time, the latter thought it her duty to show her)Tj
T*(sense of affront by saying as little as possible to her young)Tj

T*(the remainder of the sentence away, and meekly took the horehound)Tj
T*(drop that Margaret offered her, to stop the 'little tickling at)Tj
T*(my chest, miss.' But almost any one but Mr. Hale would have had)Tj
T*(practical knowledge enough to see, that in so short a time it)Tj
T*(would be difficult to fix on any house in Milton-Northern, or)Tj
T*(indeed elsewhere, to which they could remove the furniture that)Tj
T*(had of necessity to be taken out of Helstone vicarage. Mrs. Hale,)Tj
T*(overpowered by all the troubles and necessities for immediate)Tj
T*(household decisions that seemed to come upon her at once, became)Tj
T*(really ill, and Margaret almost felt it as a relief when her)Tj
T*(mother fairly took to her bed, and left the management of affairs)Tj

T*(faithfully to her mistress, and only emerged from Mrs. Hale's)Tj

T*(The last day came; the house was full of packing-cases, which)Tj

T*(unsightly and untidy by the straw that had been wafted upon it)Tj
T*(through the open door and windows. The rooms had a strange)Tj
T*(echoing sound in them,--and the light came harshly and strongly)Tj
T*(in through the uncurtained windows,--seeming already unfamiliar)Tj
T*(and strange. Mrs. Hale's dressing-room was left untouched to the)Tj
T*(last; and there she and Dixon were packing up clothes, and)Tj
T*(interrupting each other every now and then to exclaim at, and)Tj
T*(turn over with fond regard, some forgotten treasure, in the shape)Tj
T*(of some relic of the children while they were yet little. They)Tj
T*(did not make much progress with their work. Down-stairs, Margaret)Tj
T*(stood calm and collected, ready to counsel or advise the men who)Tj
T*(had been called in to help the cook and Charlotte. These two)Tj
T*(last, crying between whiles, wondered how the young lady could)Tj
T*(keep up so this last day, and settled it between them that she)Tj
T*(was not likely to care much for Helstone, having been so long in)Tj
T*(London. There she stood, very pale and quiet, with her large)Tj
T*(grave eyes observing everything,--up to every present)Tj
T*(circumstance, however small. They could not understand how her)Tj
T*(heart was aching all the time, with a heavy pressure that no)Tj
T*(sighs could lift off or relieve, and how constant exertion for)Tj
T*(her perceptive faculties was the only way to keep herself from)Tj
T*(crying out with pain. Moreover, if she gave way, who was to act?)Tj
T*(Her father was examining papers, books, registers, what not, in)Tj
T*(the vestry with the clerk; and when he came in, there were his)Tj
T*(own books to pack up, which no one but himself could do to his)Tj
T*(satisfaction. Besides, was Margaret one to give way before)Tj
T*(strange men, or even household friends like the cook and)Tj
T*(Charlotte! Not she. But at last the four packers went into the)Tj
T*(kitchen to their tea; and Margaret moved stiffly and slowly away)Tj
T*(from the place in the hall where she had been standing so long,)Tj
T*(out through the bare echoing drawing-room, into the twilight of)Tj
T*(an early November evening. There was a filmy veil of soft dull)Tj

T*(father had so often talked of as his winter pet, and for which he)Tj

T*(study-window. The leaves were more gorgeous than ever; the first)Tj
T*(touch of frost would lay them all low on the ground. Already one)Tj
T*(or two kept constantly floating down, amber and golden in the low)Tj
T*(slanting sun-rays.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret went along the walk under the pear-tree wall. She had)Tj
T*(never been along it since she paced it at Henry Lennox's side.)Tj
T*(Here, at this bed of thyme, he began to speak of what she must)Tj
T*(not think of now. Her eyes were on that late-blowing rose as she)Tj
T*(was trying to answer; and she had caught the idea of the vivid)Tj
T*(beauty of the feathery leaves of the carrots in the very middle)Tj
T*(of his last sentence. Only a fortnight ago And all so changed!)Tj
T*(Where was he now? In London,--going through the old round; dining)Tj
T*(with the old Harley Street set, or with gayer young friends of)Tj
T*(his own. Even now, while she walked sadly through that damp and)Tj
T*(drear garden in the dusk, with everything falling and fading, and)Tj
T*(turning to decay around her, he might be gladly putting away his)Tj
T*(law-books after a day of satisfactory toil, and freshening)Tj
T*(himself up, as he had told her he often did, by a run in the)Tj
T*(Temple Gardens, taking in the while the grand inarticulate mighty)Tj
T*(roar of tens of thousands of busy men, nigh at hand, but not)Tj
T*(seen, and catching ever, at his quick turns, glimpses of the)Tj
T*(lights of the city coming up out of the depths of the river. He)Tj
T*(had often spoken to Margaret of these hasty walks, snatched in)Tj
T*(the intervals between study and dinner. At his best times and in)Tj
T*(his best moods had he spoken of them; and the thought of them had)Tj
T*(struck upon her fancy. Here there was no sound. The robin had)Tj
T*(gone away into the vast stillness of night. Now and then, a)Tj
T*(cottage door in the distance was opened and shut, as if to admit)Tj
T*(the tired labourer to his home; but that sounded very far away. A)Tj
T*(stealthy, creeping, cranching sound among the crisp fallen leaves)Tj
T*(of the forest, beyond the garden, seemed almost close at hand.)Tj
T*(Margaret knew it was some poacher. Sitting up in her bed-room)Tj
T*(this past autumn, with the light of her candle extinguished, and)Tj
T*(purely revelling in the solemn beauty of the heavens and the)Tj
T*(earth, she had many a time seen the light noiseless leap of the)Tj
T*(poachers over the garden-fence, their quick tramp across the dewy)Tj
T*(moonlit lawn, their disappearance in the black still shadow)Tj
T*(beyond. The wild adventurous freedom of their life had taken her)Tj
T*(fancy; she felt inclined to wish them success; she had no fear of)Tj
T*(them. But to-night she was afraid, she knew not why. She heard)Tj
T*(Charlotte shutting the windows, and fastening up for the night,)Tj
T*(unconscious that any one had gone out into the garden. A small)Tj
T*(branch--it might be of rotten wood, or it might be broken by)Tj
T*(force--came heavily down in the nearest part of the forest,)Tj
T*(Margaret ran, swift as Camilla, down to the window, and rapped at)Tj
T*(it with a hurried tremulousness which startled Charlotte within.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Let me in! Let me in! It is only me, Charlotte!' Her heart did)Tj
T*(not still its fluttering till she was safe in the drawing-room,)Tj
T*(with the windows fastened and bolted, and the familiar walls)Tj
T*(hemming her round, and shutting her in. She had sate down upon a)Tj
T*(packing case; cheerless, Chill was the dreary and dismantled)Tj
T*(room--no fire nor other light, but Charlotte's long unsnuffed)Tj
T*(candle. Charlotte looked at Margaret with surprise; and Margaret,)Tj

T*(made her strive to look out to catch the last glimpse of the old)Tj
T*(church tower at the turn where she knew it might be seen above a)Tj
T*(wave of the forest trees; but her father remembered this too, and)Tj
T*(she silently acknowledged his greater right to the one window)Tj
T*(from which it could be seen. She leant back and shut her eyes,)Tj
T*(and the tears welled forth, and hung glittering for an instant on)Tj
T*(the shadowing eye-lashes before rolling slowly down her cheeks,)Tj
T*(and dropping, unheeded, on her dress.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They were to stop in London all night at some quiet hotel. Poor)Tj
T*(Mrs. Hale had cried in her way nearly all day long; and Dixon)Tj
T*(showed her sorrow by extreme crossness, and a continual irritable)Tj
T*(attempt to keep her petticoats from even touching the unconscious)Tj
T*(Mr. Hale, whom she regarded as the origin of all this suffering.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They went through the well-known streets, past houses which they)Tj
T*(had often visited, past shops in which she had lounged,)Tj
T*(impatient, by her aunt's side, while that lady was making some)Tj
T*(important and interminable decision-nay, absolutely past)Tj
T*(acquaintances in the streets; for though the morning had been of)Tj
T*(an incalculable length to them, and they felt as if it ought long)Tj
T*(ago to have closed in for the repose of darkness, it was the very)Tj
T*(busiest time of a London afternoon in November when they arrived)Tj
T*(there. It was long since Mrs. Hale had been in London; and she)Tj
T*(roused up, almost like a child, to look about her at the)Tj
T*(different streets, and to gaze after and exclaim at the shops and)Tj
T*(carriages.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, there's Harrison's, where I bought so many of my wedding-things.)Tj
T*(Dear! how altered! They've got immense plate-glass windows, larger)Tj
T*(than Crawford's in Southampton. Oh, and there, I declare--no, it)Tj
T*(is not--yes, it is--Margaret, we have just passed Mr. Henry Lennox.)Tj
T*(Where can he be going, among all these shops?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret started forwards, and as quickly fell back, half-smiling)Tj
T*(at herself for the sudden motion. They were a hundred yards away)Tj
T*(by this time; but he seemed like a relic of Helstone--he was)Tj
T*(associated with a bright morning, an eventful day, and she should)Tj
T*(have liked to have seen him, without his seeing her,--without the)Tj
T*(chance of their speaking.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The evening, without employment, passed in a room high up in an)Tj
T*(hotel, was long and heavy. Mr. Hale went out to his bookseller's,)Tj
T*(and to call on a friend or two. Every one they saw, either in the)Tj
T*(house or out in the streets, appeared hurrying to some)Tj
T*(appointment, expected by, or expecting somebody. They alone)Tj
T*(seemed strange and friendless, and desolate. Yet within a mile,)Tj

T*(The next afternoon, about twenty miles from Milton-Northern, they)Tj
T*(entered on the little branch railway that led to Heston. Heston)Tj
T*(itself was one long straggling street, running parallel to the)Tj
T*(seashore. It had a character of its own, as different from the)Tj
T*(little bathing-places in the south of England as they again from)Tj
T*(those of the continent. To use a Scotch word, every thing looked)Tj
T*(more 'purposelike.' The country carts had more iron, and less)Tj
T*(wood and leather about the horse-gear; the people in the streets,)Tj
T*(although on pleasure bent, had yet a busy mind. The colours)Tj
T*(looked grayer--more enduring, not so gay and pretty. There were)Tj
T*(no smock-frocks, even among the country folk; they retarded)Tj
T*(motion, and were apt to catch on machinery, and so the habit of)Tj
T*(wearing them had died out. In such towns in the south of England,)Tj
T*(Margaret had seen the shopmen, when not employed in their)Tj
T*(business, lounging a little at their doors, enjoying the fresh)Tj
T*(air, and the look up and down the street. Here, if they had any)Tj
T*(leisure from customers, they made themselves business in the)Tj
T*(shop--even, Margaret fancied, to the unnecessary unrolling and)Tj
T*(rerolling of ribbons. All these differences struck upon her mind,)Tj
T*(as she and her mother went out next morning to look for lodgings.)Tj

T*(wishing to contemplate the future.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But the future must be met, however stern and iron it be. One)Tj
T*(evening it was arranged that Margaret and her father should go)Tj
T*(the next day to Milton-Northern, and look out for a house. Mr.)Tj
T*(Hale had received several letters from Mr. Bell, and one or two)Tj
T*(from Mr. Thornton, and he was anxious to ascertain at once a good)Tj
T*(many particulars respecting his position and chances of success)Tj
T*(there, which he could only do by an interview with the latter)Tj
T*(gentleman. Margaret knew that they ought to be removing; but she)Tj
T*(had a repugnance to the idea of a manufacturing town, and)Tj
T*(believed that her mother was receiving benefit from Heston air,)Tj
T*(so she would willingly have deferred the expedition to Milton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(For several miles before they reached Milton, they saw a deep)Tj
T*(lead-coloured cloud hanging over the horizon in the direction in)Tj
T*(which it lay. It was all the darker from contrast with the pale)Tj
T*(gray-blue of the wintry sky; for in Heston there had been the)Tj
T*(earliest signs of frost. Nearer to the town, the air had a faint)Tj
T*(taste and smell of smoke; perhaps, after all, more a loss of the)Tj
T*(fragrance of grass and herbage than any positive taste or smell.)Tj
T*(Quick they were whirled over long, straight, hopeless streets of)Tj
T*(regularly-built houses, all small and of brick. Here and there a)Tj
T*(great oblong many-windowed factory stood up, like a hen among her)Tj
T*(chickens, puffing out black 'unparliamentary' smoke, and)Tj
T*(sufficiently accounting for the cloud which Margaret had taken to)Tj
T*(foretell rain. As they drove through the larger and wider)Tj
T*(streets, from the station to the hotel, they had to stop)Tj
T*(constantly; great loaded lurries blocked up the not over-wide)Tj
T*(thoroughfares. Margaret had now and then been into the city in)Tj
T*(her drives with her aunt. But there the heavy lumbering vehicles)Tj
T*(seemed various in their purposes and intent; here every van,)Tj
T*(every waggon and truck, bore cotton, either in the raw shape in)Tj
T*(bags, or the woven shape in bales of calico. People thronged the)Tj
T*(footpaths, most of them well-dressed as regarded the material,)Tj
T*(but with a slovenly looseness which struck Margaret as different)Tj
T*(from the shabby, threadbare smartness of a similar class in)Tj
T*(London.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('New Street,' said Mr. Hale. 'This, I believe, is the principal)Tj
T*(street in Milton. Bell has often spoken to me about it. It was)Tj
T*(the opening of this street from a lane into a great thoroughfare,)Tj
T*(thirty years ago, which has caused his property to rise so much)Tj
T*(in value. Mr. Thornton's mill must be somewhere not very far off,)Tj
T*(for he is Mr. Bell's tenant. But I fancy he dates from his)Tj
T*(warehouse.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Where is our hotel, papa?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Close to the end of this street, I believe. Shall we have lunch)Tj
T*(before or after we have looked at the houses we marked in the)Tj
T*(Milton Times?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, let us get our work done first.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Very well. Then I will only see if there is any note or letter)Tj
T*(for me from Mr. Thornton, who said he would let me know anything)Tj
T*(he might hear about these houses, and then we will set off. We)Tj
T*(will keep the cab; it will be safer than losing ourselves, and)Tj
T*(being too late for the train this afternoon.')Tj

T*(There were no letters awaiting him. They set out on their)Tj
T*(house-hunting. Thirty pounds a-year was all they could afford to)Tj
T*(give, but in Hampshire they could have met with a roomy house and)Tj
T*(pleasant garden for the money. Here, even the necessary)Tj
T*(accommodation of two sitting-rooms and four bed-rooms seemed)Tj

T*('But Dixon, and the girl we are to have to help?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, wait a minute. I am overpowered by the discovery of my own)Tj
T*(genius for management. Dixon is to have--let me see, I had it)Tj
T*(once--the back sitting-room. I think she will like that. She)Tj

T*('Thank you. My father will return soon, and then you can tell)Tj

T*(one who had shown himself obliging, she was disposed to treat him)Tj
T*(with a full measure of civility. Mr. Thornton was a good deal)Tj
T*(more surprised and discomfited than she. Instead of a quiet,)Tj
T*(middle-aged clergyman, a young lady came forward with frank)Tj
T*(dignity,--a young lady of a different type to most of those he)Tj
T*(was in the habit of seeing. Her dress was very plain: a close)Tj
T*(straw bonnet of the best material and shape, trimmed with white)Tj
T*(ribbon; a dark silk gown, without any trimming or flounce; a)Tj
T*(large Indian shawl, which hung about her in long heavy folds, and)Tj
T*(which she wore as an empress wears her drapery. He did not)Tj
T*(understand who she was, as he caught the simple, straight,)Tj
T*(unabashed look, which showed that his being there was of no)Tj
T*(concern to the beautiful countenance, and called up no flush of)Tj
T*(surprise to the pale ivory of the complexion. He had heard that)Tj

T*(little girl.)Tj

T*('Mr. Thornton, I believe!' said Margaret, after a half-instant's)Tj

T*(must be confessed, after his rough encounter with Milton streets)Tj

T*(doing, instead of sitting there, answering with curt sentences)Tj
T*(all the remarks she made. She had taken off her shawl, and hung)Tj

T*(in the valley, made by the sweeping bend of the river, was all)Tj
T*(shut out when Mrs. Hale arrived at her new home.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret and Dixon had been at work for two days, unpacking and)Tj
T*(arranging, but everything inside the house still looked in)Tj
T*(disorder; and outside a thick fog crept up to the very windows,)Tj
T*(and was driven in to every open door in choking white wreaths of)Tj
T*(unwholesome mist.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, Margaret! are we to live here?' asked Mrs. Hale in blank)Tj
T*(dismay. Margaret's heart echoed the dreariness of the tone in)Tj
T*(which this question was put. She could scarcely command herself)Tj
T*(enough to say, 'Oh, the fogs in London are sometimes far worse!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But then you knew that London itself, and friends lay behind it.)Tj
T*(Here--well! we are desolate. Oh Dixon, what a place this is!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Indeed, ma'am, I'm sure it will be your death before long, and)Tj
T*(then I know who'll--stay! Miss Hale, that's far too heavy for you)Tj
T*(to lift.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not at all, thank you, Dixon,' replied Margaret, coldly. 'The)Tj
T*(best thing we can do for mamma is to get her room quite ready for)Tj
T*(her to go to bed, while I go and bring her a cup of coffee.')Tj

T*(Mr. Hale was equally out of spirits, and equally came upon)Tj
T*(Margaret for sympathy.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Margaret, I do believe this is an unhealthy place. Only suppose)Tj
T*(that your mother's health or yours should suffer. I wish I had)Tj
T*(gone into some country place in Wales; this is really terrible,')Tj
T*(said he, going up to the window. There was no comfort to be)Tj
T*(given. They were settled in Milton, and must endure smoke and)Tj
T*(fogs for a season; indeed, all other life seemed shut out from)Tj
T*(them by as thick a fog of circumstance. Only the day before, Mr.)Tj
T*(Hale had been reckoning up with dismay how much their removal and)Tj
T*(fortnight at Heston had cost, and he found it had absorbed nearly)Tj
T*(all his little stock of ready money. No! here they were, and here)Tj

T*(down in a stupor of despair. The heavy smoky air hung about her)Tj
T*(bedroom, which occupied the long narrow projection at the back of)Tj
T*(the house. The window, placed at the side of the oblong, looked)Tj
T*(to the blank wall of a similar projection, not above ten feet)Tj
T*(distant. It loomed through the fog like a great barrier to hope.)Tj
T*(Inside the room everything was in confusion. All their efforts)Tj
T*(had been directed to make her mother's room comfortable. Margaret)Tj
T*(sat down on a box, the direction card upon which struck her as)Tj
T*(having been written at Helstone--beautiful, beloved Helstone! She)Tj
T*(lost herself in dismal thought: but at last she determined to)Tj
T*(take her mind away from the present; and suddenly remembered that)Tj
T*(she had a letter from Edith which she had only half read in the)Tj
T*(bustle of the morning. It was to tell of their arrival at Corfu;)Tj
T*(their voyage along the Mediterranean--their music, and dancing on)Tj
T*(board ship; the gay new life opening upon her; her house with its)Tj
T*(trellised balcony, and its views over white cliffs and deep blue)Tj
T*(sea. Edith wrote fluently and well, if not graphically. She could)Tj
T*(not only seize the salient and characteristic points of a scene,)Tj
T*(but she could enumerate enough of indiscriminate particulars for)Tj
T*(Margaret to make it out for herself Captain Lennox and another)Tj
T*(lately married officer shared a villa, high up on the beautiful)Tj
T*(precipitous rocks overhanging the sea. Their days, late as it was)Tj
T*(in the year, seemed spent in boating or land pic-nics; all)Tj
T*(out-of-doors, pleasure-seeking and glad, Edith's life seemed like)Tj
T*(the deep vault of blue sky above her, free--utterly free from)Tj
T*(fleck or cloud. Her husband had to attend drill, and she, the)Tj
T*(most musical officer's wife there, had to copy the new and)Tj
T*(popular tunes out of the most recent English music, for the)Tj
T*(benefit of the bandmaster; those seemed their most severe and)Tj
T*(arduous duties. She expressed an affectionate hope that, if the)Tj
T*(regiment stopped another year at Corfu, Margaret might come out)Tj
T*(and pay her a long visit. She asked Margaret if she remembered)Tj
T*(the day twelve-month on which she, Edith, wrote--how it rained)Tj
T*(all day long in Harley Street; and how she would not put on her)Tj
T*(new gown to go to a stupid dinner, and get it all wet and)Tj
T*(splashed in going to the carriage; and how at that very dinner)Tj
T*(they had first met Captain Lennox.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Yes! Margaret remembered it well. Edith and Mrs. Shaw had gone to)Tj
T*(dinner. Margaret had joined the party in the evening. The)Tj
T*(recollection of the plentiful luxury of all the arrangements, the)Tj
T*(stately handsomeness of the furniture, the size of the house, the)Tj
T*(peaceful, untroubled ease of the visitors--all came vividly)Tj
T*(before her, in strange contrast to the present time. The smooth)Tj
T*(sea of that old life closed up, without a mark left to tell where)Tj
T*(they had all been. The habitual dinners, the calls, the shopping,)Tj
T*(the dancing evenings, were all going on, going on for ever,)Tj
T*(though her Aunt Shaw and Edith were no longer there; and she, of)Tj
T*(course, was even less missed. She doubted if any one of that old)Tj
T*(set ever thought of her, except Henry Lennox. He too, she knew,)Tj
T*(would strive to forget her, because of the pain she had caused)Tj
T*(him. She had heard him often boast of his power of putting any)Tj
T*(disagreeable thought far away from him. Then she penetrated)Tj
T*(farther into what might have been. If she had cared for him as a)Tj
T*(lover, and had accepted him, and this change in her father's)Tj
T*(opinions and consequent station had taken place, she could not)Tj
T*(doubt but that it would have been impatiently received by Mr.)Tj
T*(Lennox. It was a bitter mortification to her in one sense; but)Tj
T*(she could bear it patiently, because she knew her father's purity)Tj
T*(of purpose, and that strengthened her to endure his errors, grave)Tj

T*(and serious though in her estimation they were. But the fact of)Tj
T*(the world esteeming her father degraded, in its rough wholesale)Tj
T*(judgment, would have oppressed and irritated Mr. Lennox. As she)Tj
T*(realised what might have been, she grew to be thankful for what)Tj
T*(was. They were at the lowest now; they could not be worse.)Tj
T*(Edith's astonishment and her aunt Shaw's dismay would have to be)Tj
T*(met bravely, when their letters came. So Margaret rose up and)Tj
T*(began slowly to undress herself, feeling the full luxury of)Tj
T*(acting leisurely, late as it was, after all the past hurry of the)Tj
T*(day. She fell asleep, hoping for some brightness, either internal)Tj
T*(or external. But if she had known how long it would be before the)Tj
T*(brightness came, her heart would have sunk low down. The time of)Tj
T*(the year was most unpropitious to health as well as to spirits.)Tj
T*(Her mother caught a severe cold, and Dixon herself was evidently)Tj
T*(not well, although Margaret could not insult her more than by)Tj
T*(trying to save her, or by taking any care of her. They could hear)Tj
T*(of no girl to assist her; all were at work in the factories; at)Tj
T*(least, those who applied were well scolded by Dixon, for thinking)Tj
T*(that such as they could ever be trusted to work in a gentleman's)Tj
T*(house. So they had to keep a charwoman in almost constant employ.)Tj
T*(Margaret longed to send for Charlotte; but besides the objection)Tj
T*(of her being a better servant than they could now afford to keep,)Tj
T*(the distance was too great.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hale met with several pupils, recommended to him by Mr. Bell,)Tj
T*(or by the more immediate influence of Mr. Thornton. They were)Tj
T*(mostly of the age when many boys would be still at school, but,)Tj
T*(according to the prevalent, and apparently well-founded notions)Tj
T*(of Milton, to make a lad into a good tradesman he must be caught)Tj
T*(young, and acclimated to the life of the mill, or office, or)Tj
T*(warehouse. If he were sent to even the Scotch Universities, he)Tj
T*(came back unsettled for commercial pursuits; how much more so if)Tj
T*(he went to Oxford or Cambridge, where he could not be entered)Tj
T*(till he was eighteen? So most of the manufacturers placed their)Tj
T*(sons in sucking situations' at fourteen or fifteen years of age,)Tj
T*(unsparingly cutting away all off-shoots in the direction of)Tj
T*(literature or high mental cultivation, in hopes of throwing the)Tj
T*(whole strength and vigour of the plant into commerce. Still there)Tj
T*(were some wiser parents; and some young men, who had sense enough)Tj
T*(to perceive their own deficiencies, and strive to remedy them.)Tj
T*(Nay, there were a few no longer youths, but men in the prime of)Tj
T*(life, who had the stern wisdom to acknowledge their own)Tj
T*(ignorance, and to learn late what they should have learnt early.)Tj
T*(Mr. Thornton was perhaps the oldest of Mr. Hale's pupils. He was)Tj
T*(certainly the favourite. Mr. Hale got into the habit of quoting)Tj
T*(his opinions so frequently, and with such regard, that it became)Tj
T*(a little domestic joke to wonder what time, during the hour)Tj
T*(appointed for instruction, could be given to absolute learning,)Tj
T*(so much of it appeared to have been spent in conversation.)Tj

T*(Margaret rather encouraged this light, merry way of viewing her)Tj

T*(occupied with his books and his parishioners, as at Helstone, she)Tj
T*(had appeared to care little whether she saw much of him or not;)Tj

T*(auditors; they were a little inclined to rebel against Aristides)Tj
T*(being always called the Just.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(After a quiet life in a country parsonage for more than twenty)Tj
T*(years, there was something dazzling to Mr. Hale in the energy)Tj
T*(which conquered immense difficulties with ease; the power of the)Tj
T*(machinery of Milton, the power of the men of Milton, impressed)Tj
T*(him with a sense of grandeur, which he yielded to without caring)Tj
T*(to inquire into the details of its exercise. But Margaret went)Tj
T*(less abroad, among machinery and men; saw less of power in its)Tj
T*(public effect, and, as it happened, she was thrown with one or)Tj
T*(two of those who, in all measures affecting masses of people,)Tj
T*(must be acute sufferers for the good of many. The question always)Tj
T*(is, has everything been done to make the sufferings of these)Tj
T*(exceptions as small as possible? Or, in the triumph of the)Tj
T*(crowded procession, have the helpless been trampled on, instead)Tj
T*(of being gently lifted aside out of the roadway of the conqueror,)Tj
T*(whom they have no power to accompany on his march?)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It fell to Margaret's share to have to look out for a servant to)Tj
T*(assist Dixon, who had at first undertaken to find just the person)Tj
T*(she wanted to do all the rough work of the house. But Dixon's)Tj
T*(ideas of helpful girls were founded on the recollection of tidy)Tj
T*(elder scholars at Helstone school, who were only too proud to be)Tj
T*(allowed to come to the parsonage on a busy day, and treated Mrs.)Tj
T*(Dixon with all the respect, and a good deal more of fright, which)Tj
T*(they paid to Mr. and Mrs. Hale. Dixon was not unconscious of this)Tj
T*(awed reverence which was given to her; nor did she dislike it; it)Tj
T*(flattered her much as Louis the Fourteenth was flattered by his)Tj
T*(courtiers shading their eyes from the dazzling light of his)Tj
T*(presence.' But nothing short of her faithful love for Mrs. Hale)Tj
T*(could have made her endure the rough independent way in which all)Tj
T*(the Milton girls, who made application for the servant's place,)Tj
T*(replied to her inquiries respecting their qualifications. They)Tj
T*(even went the length of questioning her back again; having doubts)Tj
T*(and fears of their own, as to the solvency of a family who lived)Tj
T*(in a house of thirty pounds a-year, and yet gave themselves airs,)Tj
T*(and kept two servants, one of them so very high and mighty. Mr.)Tj
T*(Hale was no longer looked upon as Vicar of Helstone, but as a man)Tj
T*(who only spent at a certain rate. Margaret was weary and)Tj
T*(impatient of the accounts which Dixon perpetually brought to Mrs.)Tj
T*(Hale of the behaviour of these would-be servants. Not but what)Tj
T*(Margaret was repelled by the rough uncourteous manners of these)Tj
T*(people; not but what she shrunk with fastidious pride from their)Tj
T*(hail-fellow accost and severely resented their unconcealed)Tj
T*(curiosity as to the means and position of any family who lived in)Tj
T*(Milton, and yet were not engaged in trade of some kind. But the)Tj
T*(more Margaret felt impertinence, the more likely she was to be)Tj
T*(silent on the subject; and, at any rate, if she took upon herself)Tj
T*(to make inquiry for a servant, she could spare her mother the)Tj
T*(recital of all her disappointments and fancied or real insults.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret accordingly went up and down to butchers and grocers,)Tj
T*(seeking for a nonpareil of a girl; and lowering her hopes and)Tj
T*(expectations every week, as she found the difficulty of meeting)Tj
T*(with any one in a manufacturing town who did not prefer the)Tj
T*(better wages and greater independence of working in a mill. It)Tj
T*(was something of a trial to Margaret to go out by herself in this)Tj

T*(footman should accompany Edith and Margaret, if they went beyond)Tj
T*(Harley Street or the immediate neighbourhood. The limits by which)Tj
T*(this rule of her aunt's had circumscribed Margaret's independence)Tj
T*(had been silently rebelled against at the time: and she had)Tj
T*(doubly enjoyed the free walks and rambles of her forest life,)Tj
T*(from the contrast which they presented. She went along there with)Tj
T*(a bounding fearless step, that occasionally broke out into a run,)Tj
T*(if she were in a hurry, and occasionally was stilled into perfect)Tj
T*(repose, as she stood listening to, or watching any of the wild)Tj
T*(creatures who sang in the leafy courts, or glanced out with their)Tj
T*(keen bright eyes from the low brushwood or tangled furze. It was)Tj
T*(a trial to come down from such motion or such stillness, only)Tj
T*(guided by her own sweet will, to the even and decorous pace)Tj
T*(necessary in streets. But she could have laughed at herself for)Tj
T*(minding this change, if it had not been accompanied by what was a)Tj
T*(more serious annoyance. The side of the town on which Crampton)Tj
T*(lay was especially a thoroughfare for the factory people. In the)Tj
T*(back streets around them there were many mills, out of which)Tj
T*(poured streams of men and women two or three times a day. Until)Tj
T*(Margaret had learnt the times of their ingress and egress, she)Tj
T*(was very unfortunate in constantly falling in with them. They)Tj
T*(came rushing along, with bold, fearless faces, and loud laughs)Tj
T*(and jests, particularly aimed at all those who appeared to be)Tj
T*(above them in rank or station. The tones of their unrestrained)Tj
T*(voices, and their carelessness of all common rules of street)Tj
T*(politeness, frightened Margaret a little at first. The girls,)Tj
T*(with their rough, but not unfriendly freedom, would comment on)Tj
T*(her dress, even touch her shawl or gown to ascertain the exact)Tj
T*(material; nay, once or twice she was asked questions relative to)Tj
T*(some article which they particularly admired. There was such a)Tj
T*(simple reliance on her womanly sympathy with their love of dress,)Tj
T*(and on her kindliness, that she gladly replied to these)Tj
T*(inquiries, as soon as she understood them; and half smiled back)Tj
T*(at their remarks. She did not mind meeting any number of girls,)Tj
T*(loud spoken and boisterous though they might be. But she)Tj
T*(alternately dreaded and fired up against the workmen, who)Tj
T*(commented not on her dress, but on her looks, in the same open)Tj
T*(fearless manner. She, who had hitherto felt that even the most)Tj
T*(refined remark on her personal appearance was an impertinence,)Tj
T*(had to endure undisguised admiration from these outspoken men.)Tj
T*(But the very out-spokenness marked their innocence of any)Tj
T*(intention to hurt her delicacy, as she would have perceived if)Tj
T*(she had been less frightened by the disorderly tumult. Out of her)Tj
T*(fright came a flash of indignation which made her face scarlet,)Tj
T*(and her dark eyes gather flame, as she heard some of their)Tj
T*(speeches. Yet there were other sayings of theirs, which, when she)Tj
T*(reached the quiet safety of home, amused her even while they)Tj
T*(irritated her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(For instance, one day, after she had passed a number of men,)Tj
T*(several of whom had paid her the not unusual compliment of)Tj
T*(wishing she was their sweetheart, one of the lingerers added,)Tj
T*('Your bonny face, my lass, makes the day look brighter.' And)Tj
T*(another day, as she was unconsciously smiling at some passing)Tj
T*(thought, she was addressed by a poorly-dressed, middle-aged)Tj
T*(workman, with 'You may well smile, my lass; many a one would)Tj
T*(smile to have such a bonny face.' This man looked so careworn)Tj
T*(that Margaret could not help giving him an answering smile, glad)Tj
T*(to think that her looks, such as they were, should have had the)Tj
T*(power to call up a pleasant thought. He seemed to understand her)Tj

T*(One day Margaret and her father had been as far as the fields)Tj
T*(that lay around the town; it was early spring, and she had)Tj
T*(gathered some of the hedge and ditch flowers, dog-violets, lesser)Tj
T*(celandines, and the like, with an unspoken lament in her heart)Tj
T*(for the sweet profusion of the South. Her father had left her to)Tj
T*(go into Milton upon some business; and on the road home she met)Tj
T*(her humble friends. The girl looked wistfully at the flowers,)Tj
T*(and, acting on a sudden impulse, Margaret offered them to her.)Tj
T*(Her pale blue eyes lightened up as she took them, and her father)Tj
T*(spoke for her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Thank yo, Miss. Bessy'll think a deal o' them flowers; that hoo)Tj

T*('No!' said Margaret, half sighing. 'I come from the South--from)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Margaret had slackened her pace to walk alongside of the man and)Tj

T*(letter to Edith, a good piece of Dante, a visit to the Higginses.)Tj
T*(But, instead, she ironed away, listening to Dixon's complaints,)Tj
T*(and only hoping that by an excess of sympathy she might prevent)Tj
T*(her from carrying the recital of her sorrows to Mrs. Hale. Every)Tj
T*(now and then, Margaret had to remind herself of her father's)Tj
T*(regard for Mr. Thornton, to subdue the irritation of weariness)Tj
T*(that was stealing over her, and bringing on one of the bad)Tj
T*(headaches to which she had lately become liable. She could hardly)Tj
T*(speak when she sat down at last, and told her mother that she was)Tj
T*(no longer Peggy the laundry-maid, but Margaret Hale the lady. She)Tj
T*(meant this speech for a little joke, and was vexed enough with)Tj
T*(her busy tongue when she found her mother taking it seriously.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes! if any one had told me, when I was Miss Beresford, and one)Tj
T*(of the belles of the county, that a child of mine would have to)Tj
T*(stand half a day, in a little poky kitchen, working away like any)Tj
T*(servant, that we might prepare properly for the reception of a)Tj
T*(tradesman, and that this tradesman should be the only'--'Oh,)Tj
T*(mamma!' said Margaret, lifting herself up, 'don't punish me so)Tj
T*(for a careless speech. I don't mind ironing, or any kind of work,)Tj
T*(for you and papa. I am myself a born and bred lady through it)Tj
T*(all, even though it comes to scouring a floor, or washing dishes.)Tj
T*(I am tired now, just for a little while; but in half an hour I)Tj
T*(shall be ready to do the same over again. And as to Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton's being in trade, why he can't help that now, poor)Tj
T*(fellow. I don't suppose his education would fit him for much)Tj
T*(else.' Margaret lifted herself slowly up, and went to her own)Tj
T*(room; for just now she could not bear much more.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In Mr. Thornton's house, at this very same time, a similar, yet)Tj
T*(different, scene was going on. A large-boned lady, long past)Tj
T*(middle age, sat at work in a grim handsomely-furnished)Tj
T*(dining-room. Her features, like her frame, were strong and)Tj
T*(massive, rather than heavy. Her face moved slowly from one)Tj
T*(decided expression to another equally decided. There was no great)Tj
T*(variety in her countenance; but those who looked at it once,)Tj
T*(generally looked at it again; even the passers-by in the street,)Tj
T*(half-turned their heads to gaze an instant longer at the firm,)Tj
T*(severe, dignified woman, who never gave way in street-courtesy,)Tj
T*(or paused in her straight-onward course to the clearly-defined)Tj
T*(end which she proposed to herself. She was handsomely dressed in)Tj
T*(stout black silk, of which not a thread was worn or discoloured.)Tj
T*(She was mending a large long table-cloth of the finest texture,)Tj
T*(holding it up against the light occasionally to discover thin)Tj
T*(places, which required her delicate care. There was not a book)Tj
T*(about in the room, with the exception of Matthew Henry's Bible)Tj
T*(Commentaries, six volumes of which lay in the centre of the)Tj
T*(massive side-board, flanked by a tea-urn on one side, and a lamp)Tj
T*(on the other. In some remote apartment, there was exercise upon)Tj
T*(the piano going on. Some one was practising up a morceau de)Tj
T*(salon, playing it very rapidly; every third note, on an average,)Tj
T*(being either indistinct, or wholly missed out, and the loud)Tj
T*(chords at the end being half of them false, but not the less)Tj
T*(satisfactory to the performer. Mrs. Thornton heard a step, like)Tj
T*(her own in its decisive character, pass the dining-room door.)Tj

T*(WROUGHT IRON AND GOLD)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('We are the trees whom shaking fastens more.')Tj
T*(GEORGE HERBERT.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Thornton left the house without coming into the dining-room)Tj
T*(again. He was rather late, and walked rapidly out to Crampton. He)Tj
T*(was anxious not to slight his new friend by any disrespectful)Tj
T*(unpunctuality. The church-clock struck half-past seven as he)Tj
T*(stood at the door awaiting Dixon's slow movements; always doubly)Tj
T*(tardy when she had to degrade herself by answering the door-bell.)Tj
T*(He was ushered into the little drawing-room, and kindly greeted)Tj
T*(by Mr. Hale, who led him up to his wife, whose pale face, and)Tj
T*(shawl-draped figure made a silent excuse for the cold languor of)Tj
T*(her greeting. Margaret was lighting the lamp when he entered, for)Tj
T*(the darkness was coming on. The lamp threw a pretty light into)Tj
T*(the centre of the dusky room, from which, with country habits,)Tj
T*(they did not exclude the night-skies, and the outer darkness of)Tj
T*(air. Somehow, that room contrasted itself with the one he had)Tj
T*(lately left; handsome, ponderous, with no sign of feminine)Tj
T*(habitation, except in the one spot where his mother sate, and no)Tj
T*(convenience for any other employment than eating and drinking. To)Tj
T*(be sure, it was a dining-room; his mother preferred to sit in it;)Tj
T*(and her will was a household law. But the drawing-room was not)Tj
T*(like this. It was twice--twenty times as fine; not one quarter as)Tj
T*(comfortable. Here were no mirrors, not even a scrap of glass to)Tj
T*(reflect the light, and answer the same purpose as water in a)Tj
T*(landscape; no gilding; a warm, sober breadth of colouring, well)Tj
T*(relieved by the dear old Helstone chintz-curtains and chair)Tj
T*(covers. An open davenport stood in the window opposite the door;)Tj
T*(in the other there was a stand, with a tall white china vase,)Tj
T*(from which drooped wreaths of English ivy, pale-green birch, and)Tj
T*(copper-coloured beech-leaves. Pretty baskets of work stood about)Tj
T*(in different places: and books, not cared for on account of their)Tj
T*(binding solely, lay on one table, as if recently put down. Behind)Tj
T*(the door was another table, decked out for tea, with a white)Tj
T*(tablecloth, on which flourished the cocoa-nut cakes, and a basket)Tj
T*(piled with oranges and ruddy American apples, heaped on leaves.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It appeared to Mr. Thornton that all these graceful cares were)Tj
T*(habitual to the family; and especially of a piece with Margaret.)Tj
T*(She stood by the tea-table in a light-coloured muslin gown, which)Tj
T*(had a good deal of pink about it. She looked as if she was not)Tj
T*(attending to the conversation, but solely busy with the tea-cups,)Tj
T*(among which her round ivory hands moved with pretty, noiseless,)Tj
T*(daintiness. She had a bracelet on one taper arm, which would fall)Tj
T*(down over her round wrist. Mr. Thornton watched the replacing of)Tj
T*(this troublesome ornament with far more attention than he)Tj
T*(listened to her father. It seemed as if it fascinated him to see)Tj
T*(her push it up impatiently, until it tightened her soft flesh;)Tj
T*(and then to mark the loosening--the fall. He could almost have)Tj
T*(exclaimed--'There it goes, again!' There was so little left to be)Tj
T*(done after he arrived at the preparation for tea, that he was)Tj
T*(almost sorry the obligation of eating and drinking came so soon)Tj
T*(to prevent his watching Margaret. She handed him his cup of tea)Tj
T*(with the proud air of an unwilling slave; but her eye caught the)Tj
T*(moment when he was ready for another cup; and he almost longed to)Tj

T*(father, who took her little finger and thumb in his masculine)Tj
T*(hand, and made them serve as sugar-tongs. Mr. Thornton saw her)Tj
T*(beautiful eyes lifted to her father, full of light, half-laughter)Tj
T*(and half-love, as this bit of pantomime went on between the two,)Tj
T*(unobserved, as they fancied, by any. Margaret's head still ached,)Tj
T*(as the paleness of her complexion, and her silence might have)Tj
T*(testified; but she was resolved to throw herself into the breach,)Tj
T*(if there was any long untoward pause, rather than that her)Tj
T*(father's friend, pupil, and guest should have cause to think)Tj
T*(himself in any way neglected. But the conversation went on; and)Tj
T*(Margaret drew into a corner, near her mother, with her work,)Tj
T*(after the tea-things were taken away; and felt that she might let)Tj
T*(her thoughts roam, without fear of being suddenly wanted to fill)Tj
T*(up a gap.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Thornton and Mr. Hale were both absorbed in the continuation)Tj
T*(of some subject which had been started at their last meeting.)Tj
T*(Margaret was recalled to a sense of the present by some trivial,)Tj
T*(low-spoken remark of her mother's; and on suddenly looking up)Tj
T*(from her work, her eye was caught by the difference of outward)Tj
T*(appearance between her father and Mr. Thornton, as betokening)Tj
T*(such distinctly opposite natures. Her father was of slight)Tj
T*(figure, which made him appear taller than he really was, when not)Tj
T*(contrasted, as at this time, with the tall, massive frame of)Tj
T*(another. The lines in her father's face were soft and waving,)Tj
T*(with a frequent undulating kind of trembling movement passing)Tj
T*(over them, showing every fluctuating emotion; the eyelids were)Tj
T*(large and arched, giving to the eyes a peculiar languid beauty)Tj
T*(which was almost feminine. The brows were finely arched, but)Tj
T*(were, by the very size of the dreamy lids, raised to a)Tj
T*(considerable distance from the eyes. Now, in Mr. Thornton's face)Tj
T*(the straight brows fell low over the clear, deep-set earnest)Tj
T*(eyes, which, without being unpleasantly sharp, seemed intent)Tj
T*(enough to penetrate into the very heart and core of what he was)Tj
T*(looking at. The lines in the face were few but firm, as if they)Tj
T*(were carved in marble, and lay principally about the lips, which)Tj
T*(were slightly compressed over a set of teeth so faultless and)Tj
T*(beautiful as to give the effect of sudden sunlight when the rare)Tj
T*(bright smile, coming in an instant and shining out of the eyes,)Tj
T*(changed the whole look from the severe and resolved expression of)Tj
T*(a man ready to do and dare everything, to the keen honest)Tj
T*(enjoyment of the moment, which is seldom shown so fearlessly and)Tj
T*(instantaneously except by children. Margaret liked this smile; it)Tj
T*(was the first thing she had admired in this new friend of her)Tj
T*(father's; and the opposition of character, shown in all these)Tj
T*(details of appearance she had just been noticing, seemed to)Tj
T*(explain the attraction they evidently felt towards each other.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She rearranged her mother's worsted-work, and fell back into her)Tj
T*(own thoughts--as completely forgotten by Mr. Thornton as if she)Tj
T*(had not been in the room, so thoroughly was he occupied in)Tj
T*(explaining to Mr. Hale the magnificent power, yet delicate)Tj
T*(adjustment of the might of the steam-hammer, which was recalling)Tj
T*(to Mr. Hale some of the wonderful stories of subservient genii in)Tj
T*(the Arabian Nights--one moment stretching from earth to sky and)Tj
T*(filling all the width of the horizon, at the next obediently)Tj
T*(compressed into a vase small enough to be borne in the hand of a)Tj

T*('As their own enemies, certainly,' said he, quickly, not a little)Tj
T*(piqued by the haughty disapproval her form of expression and tone)Tj
T*(of speaking implied. But, in a moment, his straightforward)Tj
T*(honesty made him feel that his words were but a poor and)Tj
T*(quibbling answer to what she had said; and, be she as scornful as)Tj
T*(she liked, it was a duty he owed to himself to explain, as truly)Tj
T*(as he could, what he did mean. Yet it was very difficult to)Tj
T*(separate her interpretation, and keep it distinct from his)Tj
T*(meaning. He could best have illustrated what he wanted to say by)Tj

T*(struggles, made with other people's money, to regain his own)Tj
T*(moderate portion of wealth. No one came forwards to help the)Tj

T*(Mr. Thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to)Tj
T*(the desired point of civility. She did not often make calls; and)Tj
T*(when she did, it was in heavy state that she went through her)Tj
T*(duties. Her son had given her a carriage; but she refused to let)Tj
T*(him keep horses for it; they were hired for the solemn occasions,)Tj
T*(when she paid morning or evening visits. She had had horses for)Tj
T*(three days, not a fortnight before, and had comfortably 'killed)Tj
T*(off' all her acquaintances, who might now put themselves to)Tj
T*(trouble and expense in their turn. Yet Crampton was too far off)Tj
T*(for her to walk; and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to)Tj
T*(whether his wish that she should call on the Hales was strong)Tj
T*(enough to bear the expense of cab-hire. She would have been)Tj
T*(thankful if it had not; for, as she said, 'she saw no use in)Tj
T*(making up friendships and intimacies with all the teachers and)Tj
T*(masters in Milton; why, he would be wanting her to call on)Tj
T*(Fanny's dancing-master's wife, the next thing!')Tj

T*(wanted you exactly to understand about it.')Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Nonsense, John. One would think you were made of money.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not quite, yet. But about the horses I'm determined. The last)Tj
T*(time you were out in a cab, you came home with a headache from)Tj
T*(the jolting.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I never complained of it, I'm sure.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No. My mother is not given to complaints,' said he, a little)Tj
T*(proudly. 'But so much the more I have to watch over you. Now as)Tj
T*(for Fanny there, a little hardship would do her good.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She is not made of the same stuff as you are, John. She could)Tj
T*(not bear it.' Mrs. Thornton was silent after this; for her last)Tj
T*(words bore relation to a subject which mortified her. She had an)Tj
T*(unconscious contempt for a weak character; and Fanny was weak in)Tj
T*(the very points in which her mother and brother were strong. Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton was not a woman much given to reasoning; her quick)Tj
T*(judgment and firm resolution served her in good stead of any long)Tj

T*(that nothing could strengthen Fanny to endure hardships)Tj

T*(she made this acknowledgment to herself about her daughter, it)Tj
T*(only gave her a kind of pitying tenderness of manner towards her;)Tj
T*(much of the same description of demeanour with which mothers are)Tj
T*(wont to treat their weak and sickly children. A stranger, a)Tj
T*(careless observer might have considered that Mrs. Thornton's)Tj

T*(John. But such a one would have been deeply mistaken. The very)Tj

T*(some kind or other, or he would not wish us to go. Make haste and)Tj
T*(put your things on.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But the little altercation between her son and her daughter did)Tj
T*(not incline Mrs. Thornton more favourably towards 'these Hales.')Tj
T*(Her jealous heart repeated her daughter's question, 'Who are)Tj

T*(attention?' It came up like a burden to a song, long after Fanny)Tj
T*(had forgotten all about it in the pleasant excitement of seeing)Tj
T*(the effect of a new bonnet in the looking-glass.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton was shy. It was only of late years that she had had)Tj
T*(leisure enough in her life to go into society; and as society she)Tj
T*(did not enjoy it. As dinner-giving, and as criticising other)Tj
T*(people's dinners, she took satisfaction in it. But this going to)Tj
T*(make acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing. She)Tj
T*(was ill at ease, and looked more than usually stern and)Tj
T*(forbidding as she entered the Hales' little drawing-room.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret was busy embroidering a small piece of cambric for some)Tj
T*(little article of dress for Edith's expected baby--'Flimsy,)Tj
T*(useless work,' as Mrs. Thornton observed to herself. She liked)Tj
T*(Mrs. Hale's double knitting far better; that was sensible of its)Tj
T*(kind. The room altogether was full of knick-knacks, which must)Tj
T*(take a long time to dust; and time to people of limited income)Tj
T*(was money. She made all these reflections as she was talking in)Tj
T*(her stately way to Mrs. Hale, and uttering all the stereotyped)Tj
T*(commonplaces that most people can find to say with their senses)Tj
T*(blindfolded. Mrs. Hale was making rather more exertion in her)Tj
T*(answers, captivated by some real old lace which Mrs. Thornton)Tj
T*(wore; 'lace,' as she afterwards observed to Dixon, 'of that old)Tj
T*(English point which has not been made for this seventy years, and)Tj
T*(which cannot be bought. It must have been an heir-loom, and shows)Tj
T*(that she had ancestors.' So the owner of the ancestral lace)Tj
T*(became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be)Tj
T*(agreeable to a visitor, by which Mrs. Hale's efforts at)Tj
T*(conversation would have been otherwise bounded. And presently,)Tj
T*(Margaret, racking her brain to talk to Fanny, heard her mother)Tj

T*(every side of the home life. But with the increase of serious and)Tj
T*(just ground of complaint, a new kind of patience had sprung up in)Tj
T*(her mother's mind. She was gentle and quiet in intense bodily)Tj
T*(suffering, almost in proportion as she had been restless and)Tj
T*(depressed when there had been no real cause for grief. Mr. Hale)Tj
T*(was in exactly that stage of apprehension which, in men of his)Tj

T*('You see, Margaret, how from the very first he disliked Captain)Tj
T*(Reid. He was second lieutenant in the ship--the Orion--in which)Tj
T*(Frederick sailed the very first time. Poor little fellow, how)Tj
T*(well he looked in his midshipman's dress, with his dirk in his)Tj
T*(hand, cutting open all the newspapers with it as if it were a)Tj
T*(paper-knife! But this Mr. Reid, as he was then, seemed to take a)Tj
T*(dislike to Frederick from the very beginning. And then--stay!)Tj
T*(these are the letters he wrote on board the Russell. When he was)Tj
T*(appointed to her, and found his old enemy Captain Reid in)Tj
T*(command, he did mean to bear all his tyranny patiently. Look!)Tj
T*(this is the letter. Just read it, Margaret. Where is it he)Tj
T*(says--Stop--'my father may rely upon me, that I will bear with)Tj
T*(all proper patience everything that one officer and gentleman can)Tj
T*(take from another. But from my former knowledge of my present)Tj
T*(captain, I confess I look forward with apprehension to a long)Tj
T*(course of tyranny on board the Russell.' You see, he promises to)Tj
T*(bear patiently, and I am sure he did, for he was the)Tj
T*(sweetest-tempered boy, when he was not vexed, that could possibly)Tj
T*(be. Is that the letter in which he speaks of Captain Reid's)Tj
T*(impatience with the men, for not going through the ship's)Tj
T*(manoeuvres as quickly as the Avenger? You see, he says that they)Tj
T*(had many new hands on board the Russell, while the Avenger had)Tj
T*(been nearly three years on the station, with nothing to do but to)Tj
T*(keep slavers off, and work her men, till they ran up and down the)Tj
T*(rigging like rats or monkeys.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret slowly read the letter, half illegible through the)Tj
T*(fading of the ink. It might be--it probably was--a statement of)Tj
T*(Captain Reid's imperiousness in trifles, very much exaggerated by)Tj
T*(the narrator, who had written it while fresh and warm from the)Tj
T*(scene of altercation. Some sailors being aloft in the)Tj
T*(main-topsail rigging, the captain had ordered them to race down,)Tj
T*(threatening the hindmost with the cat-of-nine-tails. He who was)Tj
T*(the farthest on the spar, feeling the impossibility of passing)Tj
T*(his companions, and yet passionately dreading the disgrace of the)Tj
T*(flogging, threw himself desperately down to catch a rope)Tj
T*(considerably lower, failed, and fell senseless on deck. He only)Tj
T*(survived for a few hours afterwards, and the indignation of the)Tj
T*(ship's crew was at boiling point when young Hale wrote.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But we did not receive this letter till long, long after we)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Oh, papa! don't imagine such things,' said Margaret, shocked.)Tj

T*('No! You know Dixon enjoys making a mystery out of trifles; and)Tj

T*(You know, papa, you said the other day I was getting fanciful.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I hope and trust you are. But don't think of what I said then. I)Tj
T*(like you to be fanciful about your mother's health. Don't be)Tj

T*(Thornton if she can tell us of a good doctor. We won't throw away)Tj
T*(our money on any but some one first-rate. Stay, we turn up this)Tj
T*(street.' The street did not look as if it could contain any house)Tj
T*(large enough for Mrs. Thornton's habitation. Her son's presence)Tj
T*(never gave any impression as to the kind of house he lived in;)Tj
T*(but, unconsciously, Margaret had imagined that tall, massive,)Tj
T*(handsomely dressed Mrs. Thornton must live in a house of the same)Tj
T*(character as herself. Now Marlborough Street consisted of long)Tj
T*(rows of small houses, with a blank wall here and there; at least)Tj
T*(that was all they could see from the point at which they entered)Tj
T*(it.)Tj

T*('He told me he lived in Marlborough Street, I'm sure,' said Mr.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The lodge-door was like a common garden-door; on one side of it)Tj
T*(were great closed gates for the ingress and egress of lurries and)Tj

T*(on one of the narrow sides of the oblong, was a handsome)Tj

T*(either side, and guarded by railing--all witnessed to its age.)Tj
T*(Margaret only wondered why people who could afford to live in so)Tj
T*(good a house, and keep it in such perfect order, did not prefer a)Tj
T*(much smaller dwelling in the country, or even some suburb; not in)Tj
T*(the continual whirl and din of the factory. Her unaccustomed ears)Tj
T*(could hardly catch her father's voice, as they stood on the steps)Tj
T*(awaiting the opening of the door. The yard, too, with the great)Tj
T*(doors in the dead wall as a boundary, was but a dismal look-out)Tj
T*(for the sitting-rooms of the house--as Margaret found when they)Tj
T*(had mounted the old-fashioned stairs, and been ushered into the)Tj
T*(drawing-room, the three windows of which went over the front door)Tj
T*(and the room on the right-hand side of the entrance. There was no)Tj
T*(one in the drawing-room. It seemed as though no one had been in)Tj
T*(it since the day when the furniture was bagged up with as much)Tj
T*(care as if the house was to be overwhelmed with lava, and)Tj
T*(discovered a thousand years hence. The walls were pink and gold;)Tj
T*(the pattern on the carpet represented bunches of flowers on a)Tj
T*(light ground, but it was carefully covered up in the centre by a)Tj
T*(linen drugget, glazed and colourless. The window-curtains were)Tj
T*(lace; each chair and sofa had its own particular veil of netting,)Tj
T*(or knitting. Great alabaster groups occupied every flat surface,)Tj
T*(safe from dust under their glass shades. In the middle of the)Tj
T*(room, right under the bagged-up chandelier, was a large circular)Tj
T*(table, with smartly-bound books arranged at regular intervals)Tj
T*(round the circumference of its polished surface, like)Tj
T*(gaily-coloured spokes of a wheel. Everything reflected light,)Tj
T*(nothing absorbed it. The whole room had a painfully spotted,)Tj
T*(spangled, speckled look about it, which impressed Margaret so)Tj
T*(unpleasantly that she was hardly conscious of the peculiar)Tj
T*(cleanliness required to keep everything so white and pure in such)Tj
T*(an atmosphere, or of the trouble that must be willingly expended)Tj
T*(to secure that effect of icy, snowy discomfort. Wherever she)Tj
T*(looked there was evidence of care and labour, but not care and)Tj
T*(labour to procure ease, to help on habits of tranquil home)Tj
T*(employment; solely to ornament, and then to preserve ornament)Tj
T*(from dirt or destruction.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They had leisure to observe, and to speak to each other in low)Tj
T*(voices, before Mrs. Thornton appeared. They were talking of what)Tj
T*(all the world might hear; but it is a common effect of such a)Tj
T*(room as this to make people speak low, as if unwilling to awaken)Tj
T*(the unused echoes.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At last Mrs. Thornton came in, rustling in handsome black silk,)Tj
T*(as was her wont; her muslins and laces rivalling, not excelling,)Tj
T*(the pure whiteness of the muslins and netting of the room.)Tj
T*(Margaret explained how it was that her mother could not accompany)Tj
T*(them to return Mrs. Thornton's call; but in her anxiety not to)Tj
T*(bring back her father's fears too vividly, she gave but a)Tj
T*(bungling account, and left the impression on Mrs. Thornton's mind)Tj
T*(that Mrs. Hale's was some temporary or fanciful fine-ladyish)Tj
T*(indisposition, which might have been put aside had there been a)Tj
T*(strong enough motive; or that if it was too severe to allow her)Tj
T*(to come out that day, the call might have been deferred.)Tj
T*(Remembering, too, the horses to her carriage, hired for her own)Tj
T*(visit to the Hales, and how Fanny had been ordered to go by Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton, in order to pay every respect to them, Mrs. Thornton)Tj
T*(drew up slightly offended, and gave Margaret no sympathy--indeed,)Tj

T*('How is Mr. Thornton?' asked Mr. Hale. 'I was afraid he was not)Tj
T*(well, from his hurried note yesterday.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My son is rarely ill; and when he is, he never speaks about it,)Tj
T*(or makes it an excuse for not doing anything. He told me he could)Tj
T*(not get leisure to read with you last night, sir. He regretted)Tj
T*(it, I am sure; he values the hours spent with you.')Tj

T*('I am sure they are equally agreeable to me,' said Mr. Hale. 'It)Tj

T*(of all that is fine in classical literature.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I have no doubt the classics are very desirable for people who)Tj
T*(have leisure. But, I confess, it was against my judgment that my)Tj
T*(son renewed his study of them. The time and place in which he)Tj

T*(that is my opinion.' This last clause she gave out with 'the)Tj
T*(pride that apes humility.')Tj

T*('But, surely, if the mind is too long directed to one object)Tj
T*(only, it will get stiff and rigid, and unable to take in many)Tj
T*(interests,' said Margaret.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I do not quite understand what you mean by a mind getting stiff)Tj
T*(and rigid. Nor do I admire those whirligig characters that are)Tj
T*(full of this thing to-day, to be utterly forgetful of it in their)Tj
T*(new interest to-morrow. Having many interests does not suit the)Tj
T*(life of a Milton manufacturer. It is, or ought to be, enough for)Tj
T*(him to have one great desire, and to bring all the purposes of)Tj
T*(his life to bear on the fulfilment of that.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And that is--?' asked Mr. Hale.)Tj

T*(Her sallow cheek flushed, and her eye lightened, as she answered:)Tj

T*('No,' said Margaret, with some spirit. 'It may be true, that I)Tj

T*(to Milton. But since I have come here, I have heard enough to)Tj
T*(make me respect and admire him, and to feel how much justice and)Tj
T*(truth there is in what you have said of him.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Who spoke to you of him?' asked Mrs. Thornton, a little)Tj
T*(mollified, yet jealous lest any one else's words should not have)Tj
T*(done him full justice. Margaret hesitated before she replied. She)Tj
T*(did not like this authoritative questioning. Mr. Hale came in, as)Tj
T*(he thought, to the rescue.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It was what Mr. Thornton said himself, that made us know the)Tj
T*(kind of man he was. Was it not, Margaret?')Tj

T*(Mrs. Thornton drew herself up, and said--)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My son is not the one to tell of his own doings. May I again ask)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Margaret replied, 'It was as much from what Mr. Thornton withheld)Tj

T*(drowsy college. But I'm obliged to you, Miss Hale. Many a missy)Tj

T*(pleasure of hearing that her son was well spoken of.')Tj

T*(She smiled a grim smile, for she had been pleased by Margaret's)Tj
T*(frankness; and perhaps she felt that she had been asking)Tj

T*(laughed outright at the notion presented to her; laughed so)Tj
T*(merrily that it grated on Mrs. Thornton's ear, as if the words)Tj

T*(they will.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('They are wanting higher wages, I suppose?' asked Mr. Hale.)Tj
T*()Tj

T*(masters and men. They'll find themselves mistaken this time, I)Tj

T*(watching Margaret.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes; the fools will have a strike. Let them. It suits us well)Tj

T*(flourishing as it was last year. We see the storm on the horizon)Tj

T*(line and letter for the way we choose to spend or save our money.)Tj
T*(Henderson tried a dodge with his men, out at Ashley, and failed.)Tj
T*(He rather wanted a strike; it would have suited his book well)Tj

T*(answer on the pay day; knowing all the while what his answer)Tj
T*(would be, of course, but thinking he'd strengthen their conceit)Tj

T*(same unreasoning obedience as when all he had to do in the way of)Tj
T*(duty was, to obey the simple laws of "Come when you're called" and)Tj

T*(Margaret went out heavily and unwillingly enough. But the length)Tj
T*(of a street--yes, the air of a Milton Street--cheered her young)Tj
T*(blood before she reached her first turning. Her step grew)Tj
T*(lighter, her lip redder. She began to take notice, instead of)Tj
T*(having her thoughts turned so exclusively inward. She saw unusual)Tj
T*(loiterers in the streets: men with their hands in their pockets)Tj
T*(sauntering along; loud-laughing and loud-spoken girls clustered)Tj
T*(together, apparently excited to high spirits, and a boisterous)Tj
T*(independence of temper and behaviour. The more ill-looking of the)Tj
T*(men--the discreditable minority--hung about on the steps of the)Tj
T*(beer-houses and gin-shops, smoking, and commenting pretty freely)Tj
T*(on every passer-by. Margaret disliked the prospect of the long)Tj
T*(walk through these streets, before she came to the fields which)Tj
T*(she had planned to reach. Instead, she would go and see Bessy)Tj
T*(Higgins. It would not be so refreshing as a quiet country walk,)Tj

T*('Well, third time pays for all. See if we don't dang th' masters)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Why do you strike?' asked Margaret. 'Striking is leaving off)Tj
T*(work till you get your own rate of wages, is it not? You must not)Tj

T*('I wish I were there,' said Bessy, wearily. 'But it's not for me)Tj

T*(ours. Upon my word, mother, I wish the old combination-laws were)Tj
T*(in force. It is too bad to find out that fools--ignorant wayward)Tj
T*(men like these--just by uniting their weak silly heads, are to)Tj
T*(rule over the fortunes of those who bring all the wisdom that)Tj
T*(knowledge and experience, and often painful thought and anxiety,)Tj
T*(can give. The next thing will be--indeed, we're all but come to)Tj
T*(it now--that we shall have to go and ask--stand hat in hand--and)Tj
T*(humbly ask the secretary of the Spinner' Union to be so kind as)Tj
T*(to furnish us with labour at their own price. That's what they)Tj
T*(want--they, who haven't the sense to see that, if we don't get a)Tj
T*(fair share of the profits to compensate us for our wear and tear)Tj
T*(here in England, we can move off to some other country; and that,)Tj
T*(what with home and foreign competition, we are none of us likely)Tj

T*(He kept on with his restless walk--not speaking any more, but)Tj
T*(drawing a deep breath from time to time, as if endeavouring to)Tj
T*(throw off some annoying thought. Fanny asked her mother numerous)Tj
T*(small questions, all having nothing to do with the subject, which)Tj
T*(a wiser person would have perceived was occupying her attention.)Tj
T*(Consequently, she received many short answers. She was not sorry)Tj
T*(when, at ten o'clock, the servants filed in to prayers. These her)Tj
T*(mother always read,--first reading a chapter. They were now)Tj
T*(working steadily through the Old Testament. When prayers were)Tj
T*(ended, and his mother had wished him goodnight, with that long)Tj
T*(steady look of hers which conveyed no expression of the)Tj
T*(tenderness that was in her heart, but yet had the intensity of a)Tj
T*(blessing, Mr. Thornton continued his walk. All his business plans)Tj
T*(had received a check, a sudden pull-up, from this approaching)Tj
T*(turn-out. The forethought of many anxious hours was thrown away,)Tj
T*(utterly wasted by their insane folly, which would injure)Tj
T*(themselves even more than him, though no one could set any limit)Tj
T*(to the mischief they were doing. And these were the men who)Tj
T*(thought themselves fitted to direct the masters in the disposal)Tj
T*(of their capital! Hamper had said, only this very day, that if he)Tj
T*(were ruined by the strike, he would start life again, comforted)Tj
T*(by the conviction that those who brought it on were in a worse)Tj
T*(predicament than he himself,--for he had head as well as hands,)Tj

T*(here was this man, from a distant county, who was perplexed by)Tj
T*(the workings of the system into the midst of which he was thrown,)Tj
T*(and each was eager to make him a judge, and to bring witness of)Tj
T*(his own causes for irritation. Then Mr. Hale brought all his)Tj
T*(budget of grievances, and laid it before Mr. Thornton, for him,)Tj
T*(with his experience as a master, to arrange them, and explain)Tj
T*(their origin; which he always did, on sound economical)Tj
T*(principles; showing that, as trade was conducted, there must)Tj
T*(always be a waxing and waning of commercial prosperity; and that)Tj
T*(in the waning a certain number of masters, as well as of men,)Tj
T*(must go down into ruin, and be no more seen among the ranks of)Tj
T*(the happy and prosperous. He spoke as if this consequence were so)Tj
T*(entirely logical, that neither employers nor employed had any)Tj
T*(right to complain if it became their fate: the employer to turn)Tj
T*(aside from the race he could no longer run, with a bitter sense)Tj
T*(of incompetency and failure--wounded in the struggle--trampled)Tj
T*(down by his fellows in their haste to get rich--slighted where he)Tj
T*(once was honoured--humbly asking for, instead of bestowing,)Tj
T*(employment with a lordly hand. Of course, speaking so of the fate)Tj
T*(that, as a master, might be his own in the fluctuations of)Tj
T*(commerce, he was not likely to have more sympathy with that of)Tj
T*(the workmen, who were passed by in the swift merciless)Tj
T*(improvement or alteration who would fain lie down and quietly die)Tj
T*(out of the world that needed them not, but felt as if they could)Tj
T*(never rest in their graves for the clinging cries of the beloved)Tj
T*(and helpless they would leave behind; who envied the power of the)Tj

T*(which, as he learnt from Dr. Donaldson, Mrs. Hale might possibly)Tj

T*(before her the doom, which she was vainly trying to persuade)Tj

T*(set Margaret's teeth on edge, as she looked at him, and listened)Tj
T*(to him. What business had he to be the only person, except Dr.)Tj
T*(Donaldson and Dixon, admitted to the awful secret, which she held)Tj
T*(shut up in the most dark and sacred recess of her heart--not)Tj
T*(daring to look at it, unless she invoked heavenly strength to)Tj
T*(bear the sight--that, some day soon, she should cry aloud for her)Tj
T*(mother, and no answer would come out of the blank, dumb darkness?)Tj
T*(Yet he knew all. She saw it in his pitying eyes. She heard it in)Tj

T*(that it would not signify if it did not go till morning, as she)Tj
T*(knew Higgins had provided for their immediate wants, and she)Tj
T*(herself had left money with Bessy. Mrs. Hale called her unfeeling)Tj
T*(for saying this; and never gave herself breathing-time till the)Tj
T*(basket was sent out of the house. Then she said:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('After all, we may have been doing wrong. It was only the last)Tj
T*(time Mr. Thornton was here that he said, those were no true)Tj

T*(up-stairs, fresh from giving a lesson to Mr. Thornton, which had)Tj
T*(ended in conversation, as was their wont. Margaret did not care)Tj
T*(if their gifts had prolonged the strike; she did not think far)Tj
T*(enough for that, in her present excited state.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hale listened, and tried to be as calm as a judge; he)Tj
T*(recalled all that had seemed so clear not half-an-hour before, as)Tj
T*(it came out of Mr. Thornton's lips; and then he made an)Tj
T*(unsatisfactory compromise. His wife and daughter had not only)Tj
T*(done quite right in this instance, but he did not see for a)Tj
T*(moment how they could have done otherwise. Nevertheless, as a)Tj
T*(general rule, it was very true what Mr. Thornton said, that as)Tj
T*(the strike, if prolonged, must end in the masters' bringing hands)Tj
T*(from a distance \(if, indeed, the final result were not, as it had)Tj
T*(often been before, the invention of some machine which would)Tj
T*(diminish the need of hands at all\), why, it was clear enough that)Tj

T*(Mr. Hale went the next morning, as he proposed. He did not find)Tj

T*(he did not look at her. Only, he knew what she was doing--or not)Tj
T*(doing--better than he knew the movements of any one else in the)Tj
T*(room. Margaret was so unconscious of herself, and so much amused)Tj
T*(by watching other people, that she never thought whether she was)Tj
T*(left unnoticed or not. Somebody took her down to dinner; she did)Tj
T*(not catch the name; nor did he seem much inclined to talk to her.)Tj
T*(There was a very animated conversation going on among the)Tj
T*(gentlemen; the ladies, for the most part, were silent, employing)Tj
T*(themselves in taking notes of the dinner and criticising each)Tj
T*(other's dresses. Margaret caught the clue to the general)Tj
T*(conversation, grew interested and listened attentively. Mr.)Tj
T*(Horsfall, the stranger, whose visit to the town was the original)Tj
T*(germ of the party, was asking questions relative to the trade and)Tj
T*(manufactures of the place; and the rest of the gentlemen--all)Tj
T*(Milton men,--were giving him answers and explanations. Some)Tj
T*(dispute arose, which was warmly contested; it was referred to Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton, who had hardly spoken before; but who now gave an)Tj
T*(opinion, the grounds of which were so clearly stated that even)Tj
T*(the opponents yielded. Margaret's attention was thus called to)Tj
T*(her host; his whole manner as master of the house, and)Tj
T*(entertainer of his friends, was so straightforward, yet simple)Tj
T*(and modest, as to be thoroughly dignified. Margaret thought she)Tj
T*(had never seen him to so much advantage. When he had come to)Tj
T*(their house, there had been always something, either of)Tj
T*(over-eagerness or of that kind of vexed annoyance which seemed)Tj
T*(ready to pre-suppose that he was unjustly judged, and yet felt)Tj
T*(too proud to try and make himself better understood. But now,)Tj
T*(among his fellows, there was no uncertainty as to his position.)Tj
T*(He was regarded by them as a man of great force of character; of)Tj
T*(power in many ways. There was no need to struggle for their)Tj
T*(respect. He had it, and he knew it; and the security of this gave)Tj
T*(a fine grand quietness to his voice and ways, which Margaret had)Tj
T*(missed before.)Tj

T*(He was not in the habit of talking to ladies; and what he did say)Tj
T*(was a little formal. To Margaret herself he hardly spoke at all.)Tj
T*(She was surprised to think how much she enjoyed this dinner. She)Tj
T*(knew enough now to understand many local interests--nay, even)Tj
T*(some of the technical words employed by the eager mill-owners.)Tj
T*(She silently took a very decided part in the question they were)Tj
T*(discussing. At any rate, they talked in desperate earnest,--not)Tj
T*(in the used-up style that wearied her so in the old London)Tj
T*(parties. She wondered that with all this dwelling on the)Tj
T*(manufactures and trade of the place, no allusion was made to the)Tj
T*(strike then pending. She did not yet know how coolly such things)Tj
T*(were taken by the masters, as having only one possible end. To be)Tj
T*(sure, the men were cutting their own throats, as they had done)Tj
T*(many a time before; but if they would be fools, and put)Tj
T*(themselves into the hands of a rascally set of paid delegates,')Tj
T*(they must take the consequence. One or two thought Thornton)Tj
T*(looked out of spirits; and, of course, he must lose by this)Tj
T*(turn-out. But it was an accident that might happen to themselves)Tj
T*(any day; and Thornton was as good to manage a strike as any one;)Tj
T*(for he was as iron a chap as any in Milton. The hands had)Tj
T*(mistaken their man in trying that dodge on him. And they chuckled)Tj
T*(inwardly at the idea of the workmen's discomfiture and defeat, in)Tj
T*(their attempt to alter one iota of what Thornton had decreed. It)Tj
T*(was rather dull for Margaret after dinner. She was glad when the)Tj
T*(gentlemen came, not merely because she caught her father's eye to)Tj
T*(brighten her sleepiness up; but because she could listen to)Tj
T*(something larger and grander than the petty interests which the)Tj
T*(ladies had been talking about. She liked the exultation in the)Tj
T*(sense of power which these Milton men had. It might be rather)Tj
T*(rampant in its display, and savour of boasting; but still they)Tj
T*(seemed to defy the old limits of possibility, in a kind of fine)Tj
T*(intoxication, caused by the recollection of what had been)Tj
T*(achieved, and what yet should be. If in her cooler moments she)Tj
T*(might not approve of their spirit in all things, still there was)Tj
T*(much to admire in their forgetfulness of themselves and the)Tj
T*(present, in their anticipated triumphs over all inanimate matter)Tj
T*(at some future time which none of them should live to see. She)Tj
T*(was rather startled when Mr. Thornton spoke to her, close at her)Tj
T*(elbow:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I could see you were on our side in our discussion at)Tj
T*(dinner,--were you not, Miss Hale?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Certainly. But then I know so little about it. I was surprised,)Tj
T*(however, to find from what Mr. Horsfall said, that there were)Tj
T*(others who thought in so diametrically opposite a manner, as the)Tj
T*(Mr. Morison he spoke about. He cannot be a gentleman--is he?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I am not quite the person to decide on another's)Tj
T*(gentlemanliness, Miss Hale. I mean, I don't quite understand your)Tj
T*(application of the word. But I should say that this Morison is no)Tj
T*(true man. I don't know who he is; I merely judge him from Mr.)Tj
T*(Horsfall's account.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I suspect my "gentleman" includes your "true man."')Tj

T*('What do you mean?' asked Margaret. 'We must understand the words)Tj
T*(differently.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I take it that "gentleman" is a term that only describes a)Tj
T*(person in his relation to others; but when we speak of him as "a)Tj
T*(man," we consider him not merely with regard to his fellow-men,)Tj
T*(but in relation to himself,--to life--to time--to eternity. A)Tj
T*(cast-away lonely as Robinson Crusoe--a prisoner immured in a)Tj
T*(dungeon for life--nay, even a saint in Patmos, has his endurance,)Tj
T*(his strength, his faith, best described by being spoken of as "a)Tj
T*(man." I am rather weary of this word "gentlemanly," which seems)Tj
T*(to me to be often inappropriately used, and often, too, with such)Tj
T*(exaggerated distortion of meaning, while the full simplicity of)Tj
T*(the noun "man," and the adjective "manly" are)Tj
T*(unacknowledged--that I am induced to class it with the cant of)Tj
T*(the day.')Tj

T*(Margaret thought a moment,--but before she could speak her slow)Tj
T*(conviction, he was called away by some of the eager)Tj
T*(manufacturers, whose speeches she could not hear, though she)Tj
T*(could guess at their import by the short clear answers Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton gave, which came steady and firm as the boom of a)Tj
T*(distant minute gun. They were evidently talking of the turn-out,)Tj
T*(and suggesting what course had best be pursued. She heard Mr.)Tj

T*('That has been done.' Then came a hurried murmur, in which two or)Tj
T*(three joined.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Some doubts were implied, some difficulties named by Mr.)Tj
T*(Slickson, who took hold of Mr. Thornton's arm, the better to)Tj
T*(impress his words. Mr. Thornton moved slightly away, lifted his)Tj
T*(eyebrows a very little, and then replied:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I take the risk. You need not join in it unless you choose.')Tj
T*(Still some more fears were urged.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I'm not afraid of anything so dastardly as incendiarism. We are)Tj
T*(open enemies; and I can protect myself from any violence that I)Tj
T*(apprehend. And I will assuredly protect all others who come to me)Tj
T*(for work. They know my determination by this time, as well and as)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Horsfall took him a little on one side, as Margaret)Tj

T*('I should be, if I were he. He must know of the growing anger and)Tj

T*(But all the reply he got, was in the choked words, 'You have)Tj
T*(never been married, Dr. Donaldson; you do not know what it is,')Tj
T*(and in the deep, manly sobs, which went through the stillness of)Tj
T*(the night like heavy pulses of agony. Margaret knelt by him,)Tj
T*(caressing him with tearful caresses. No one, not even Dr.)Tj
T*(Donaldson, knew how the time went by. Mr. Hale was the first to)Tj
T*(dare to speak of the necessities of the present moment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What must we do?' asked he. 'Tell us both. Margaret is my)Tj
T*(staff--my right hand.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Dr. Donaldson gave his clear, sensible directions. No fear for)Tj
T*(to-night--nay, even peace for to-morrow, and for many days yet.)Tj
T*(But no enduring hope of recovery. He advised Mr. Hale to go to)Tj
T*(bed, and leave only one to watch the slumber, which he hoped)Tj
T*(would be undisturbed. He promised to come again early in the)Tj
T*(morning. And with a warm and kindly shake of the hand, he left)Tj
T*(them. They spoke but few words; they were too much exhausted by)Tj
T*(their terror to do more than decide upon the immediate course of)Tj
T*(action. Mr. Hale was resolved to sit up through the night, and)Tj
T*(all that Margaret could do was to prevail upon him to rest on the)Tj
T*(drawing-room sofa. Dixon stoutly and bluntly refused to go to)Tj
T*(bed; and, as for Margaret, it was simply impossible that she)Tj
T*(should leave her mother, let all the doctors in the world speak)Tj
T*(of 'husbanding resources,' and 'one watcher only being required.')Tj
T*(So, Dixon sat, and stared, and winked, and drooped, and picked)Tj
T*(herself up again with a jerk, and finally gave up the battle, and)Tj
T*(fairly snored. Margaret had taken off her gown and tossed it)Tj
T*(aside with a sort of impatient disgust, and put on her)Tj
T*(dressing-gown. She felt as if she never could sleep again; as if)Tj
T*(her whole senses were acutely vital, and all endued with double)Tj
T*(keenness, for the purposes of watching. Every sight and)Tj
T*(sound--nay, even every thought, touched some nerve to the very)Tj
T*(quick. For more than two hours, she heard her father's restless)Tj
T*(movements in the next room. He came perpetually to the door of)Tj
T*(her mother's chamber, pausing there to listen, till she, not)Tj
T*(hearing his close unseen presence, went and opened it to tell him)Tj
T*(how all went on, in reply to the questions his baked lips could)Tj
T*(hardly form. At last he, too, fell asleep, and all the house was)Tj
T*(still. Margaret sate behind the curtain thinking. Far away in)Tj
T*(time, far away in space, seemed all the interests of past days.)Tj
T*(Not more than thirty-six hours ago, she cared for Bessy Higgins)Tj

T*(was all like a dreaming memory of some former life;--everything)Tj
T*(that had passed out of doors seemed dissevered from her mother,)Tj
T*(and therefore unreal. Even Harley Street appeared more distinct;)Tj
T*(there she remembered, as if it were yesterday, how she had)Tj
T*(pleased herself with tracing out her mother's features in her)Tj
T*(Aunt Shaw's face,--and how letters had come, making her dwell on)Tj
T*(the thoughts of home with all the longing of love. Helstone,)Tj
T*(itself, was in the dim past. The dull gray days of the preceding)Tj
T*(winter and spring, so uneventless and monotonous, seemed more)Tj
T*(associated with what she cared for now above all price. She would)Tj
T*(fain have caught at the skirts of that departing time, and prayed)Tj

T*(I've a long round to take. It would do you no harm to have a)Tj
T*(brisk walk to Marlborough Street, and ask Mrs. Thornton if she)Tj
T*(can spare it.')Tj

T*('Certainly,' said Margaret. 'I could go while mamma is asleep)Tj
T*(this afternoon. I'm sure Mrs. Thornton would lend it to us.')Tj

T*(Dr. Donaldson's experience told them rightly. Mrs. Hale seemed to)Tj

T*(Marlborough Street before the full conviction forced itself upon)Tj
T*(her, that there was a restless, oppressive sense of irritation)Tj
T*(abroad among the people; a thunderous atmosphere, morally as well)Tj
T*(as physically, around her. From every narrow lane opening out on)Tj
T*(Marlborough Street came up a low distant roar, as of myriads of)Tj
T*(fierce indignant voices. The inhabitants of each poor squalid)Tj
T*(dwelling were gathered round the doors and windows, if indeed)Tj
T*(they were not actually standing in the middle of the narrow)Tj
T*(ways--all with looks intent towards one point. Marlborough Street)Tj
T*(itself was the focus of all those human eyes, that betrayed)Tj
T*(intensest interest of various kinds; some fierce with anger, some)Tj
T*(lowering with relentless threats, some dilated with fear, or)Tj
T*(imploring entreaty; and, as Margaret reached the small)Tj
T*(side-entrance by the folding doors, in the great dead wall of)Tj
T*(Marlborough mill-yard and waited the porter's answer to the bell,)Tj
T*(she looked round and heard the first long far-off roll of the)Tj

T*(with its threatening crest, tumble over, and retreat, at the far)Tj
T*(end of the street, which a moment ago, seemed so full of)Tj
T*(repressed noise, but which now was ominously still; all these)Tj
T*(circumstances forced themselves on Margaret's notice, but did not)Tj
T*(sink down into her pre-occupied heart. She did not know what they)Tj
T*(meant--what was their deep significance; while she did know, did)Tj
T*(feel the keen sharp pressure of the knife that was soon to stab)Tj
T*(her through and through by leaving her motherless. She was trying)Tj
T*(to realise that, in order that, when it came, she might be ready)Tj
T*(to comfort her father.)Tj

T*(admit her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It's you, is it, ma'am?' said he, drawing a long breath, and)Tj

T*(Margaret was shown into the drawing-room. It had returned into)Tj
T*(its normal state of bag and covering. The windows were half open)Tj
T*(because of the heat, and the Venetian blinds covered the)Tj
T*(glass,--so that a gray grim light, reflected from the pavement)Tj
T*(below, threw all the shadows wrong, and combined with the)Tj
T*(green-tinged upper light to make even Margaret's own face, as she)Tj
T*(caught it in the mirrors, look ghastly and wan. She sat and)Tj
T*(waited; no one came. Every now and then, the wind seemed to bear)Tj
T*(the distant multitudinous sound nearer; and yet there was no)Tj
T*(wind! It died away into profound stillness between whiles.)Tj

T*(Fanny came in at last.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mamma will come directly, Miss Hale. She desired me to apologise)Tj
T*(to you as it is. Perhaps you know my brother has imported hands)Tj
T*(from Ireland, and it has irritated the Milton people)Tj
T*(excessively--as if he hadn't a right to get labour where he)Tj
T*(could; and the stupid wretches here wouldn't work for him; and)Tj
T*(now they've frightened these poor Irish starvelings so with their)Tj
T*(threats, that we daren't let them out. You may see them huddled)Tj
T*(in that top room in the mill,--and they're to sleep there, to)Tj
T*(keep them safe from those brutes, who will neither work nor let)Tj
T*(them work. And mamma is seeing about their food, and John is)Tj
T*(speaking to them, for some of the women are crying to go back.)Tj
T*(Ah! here's mamma!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton came in with a look of black sternness on her face,)Tj
T*(which made Margaret feel she had arrived at a bad time to trouble)Tj
T*(her with her request. However, it was only in compliance with)Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton's expressed desire, that she would ask for whatever)Tj
T*(they might want in the progress of her mother's illness. Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton's brow contracted, and her mouth grew set, while)Tj
T*(Margaret spoke with gentle modesty of her mother's restlessness,)Tj
T*(and Dr. Donaldson's wish that she should have the relief of a)Tj
T*(water-bed. She ceased. Mrs. Thornton did not reply immediately.)Tj

T*(And simultaneously, the gathering tramp--to which she had been)Tj

T*(right outside the wall, and an increasing din of angry voices)Tj
T*(raged behind the wooden barrier, which shook as if the unseen)Tj

T*(a short space only to come with more united steady impetus)Tj

T*(good courage to them, before he locked the factory-door. Then he)Tj

T*(voiceless, wordless, needing all their breath for their)Tj
T*(hard-labouring efforts to break down the gates. But now, hearing)Tj
T*(him speak inside, they set up such a fierce unearthly groan, that)Tj
T*(even Mrs. Thornton was white with fear as she preceded him into)Tj
T*(the room. He came in a little flushed, but his eyes gleaming, as)Tj
T*(in answer to the trumpet-call of danger, and with a proud look of)Tj
T*(defiance on his face, that made him a noble, if not a handsome)Tj
T*(man. Margaret had always dreaded lest her courage should fail her)Tj
T*(in any emergency, and she should be proved to be, what she)Tj
T*(dreaded lest she was--a coward. But now, in this real great time)Tj
T*(of reasonable fear and nearness of terror, she forgot herself,)Tj

T*(upper-servant. And she went, followed by the others.)Tj

T*('I stop here!' said his mother. 'Where you are, there I stay.')Tj
T*(And indeed, retreat into the back rooms was of no avail; the)Tj
T*(crowd had surrounded the outbuildings at the rear, and were)Tj
T*(sending forth their awful threatening roar behind. The servants)Tj
T*(retreated into the garrets, with many a cry and shriek. Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton smiled scornfully as he heard them. He glanced at)Tj
T*(Margaret, standing all by herself at the window nearest the)Tj
T*(factory. Her eyes glittered, her colour was deepened on cheek and)Tj
T*(lip. As if she felt his look, she turned to him and asked a)Tj
T*(question that had been for some time in her mind:)Tj

T*('Where are the poor imported work-people? In the factory there?')Tj

T*(terror in the tones of her voice.)Tj

T*('Shut down the windows instantly, mother,' exclaimed he: 'the)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(From some cause or other, there was a pause of several minutes in)Tj
T*(the unseen street. Mrs. Thornton looked with wild anxiety at her)Tj
T*(son's countenance, as if to gain the interpretation of the sudden)Tj
T*(stillness from him. His face was set into rigid lines of)Tj
T*(contemptuous defiance; neither hope nor fear could be read there.)Tj

T*(Fanny raised herself up:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Are they gone?' asked she, in a whisper.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Gone!' replied he. 'Listen!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She did listen; they all could hear the one great straining)Tj
T*(breath; the creak of wood slowly yielding; the wrench of iron;)Tj
T*(the mighty fall of the ponderous gates. Fanny stood up)Tj
T*(tottering--made a step or two towards her mother, and fell)Tj
T*(forwards into her arms in a fainting fit. Mrs. Thornton lifted)Tj
T*(her up with a strength that was as much that of the will as of)Tj
T*(the body, and carried her away.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Thank God!' said Mr. Thornton, as he watched her out. 'Had you)Tj
T*(not better go upstairs, Miss Hale?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret's lips formed a 'No!'--but he could not hear her speak,)Tj
T*(for the tramp of innumerable steps right under the very wall of)Tj
T*(the house, and the fierce growl of low deep angry voices that had)Tj
T*(a ferocious murmur of satisfaction in them, more dreadful than)Tj
T*(their baffled cries not many minutes before.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Never mind!' said he, thinking to encourage her. 'I am very)Tj
T*(sorry you should have been entrapped into all this alarm; but it)Tj
T*(cannot last long now; a few minutes more, and the soldiers will)Tj
T*(be here.')Tj

T*('Oh, God!' cried Margaret, suddenly; 'there is Boucher. I know)Tj

T*('Who is Boucher?' asked Mr. Thornton, coolly, and coming close to)Tj

T*(window. He was on the steps below; she saw that by the direction)Tj
T*(of a thousand angry eyes; but she could neither see nor hear)Tj
T*(any-thing save the savage satisfaction of the rolling angry)Tj
T*(murmur. She threw the window wide open. Many in the crowd were)Tj
T*(mere boys; cruel and thoughtless,--cruel because they were)Tj
T*(thoughtless; some were men, gaunt as wolves, and mad for prey.)Tj
T*(She knew how it was; they were like Boucher, with starving)Tj
T*(children at home--relying on ultimate success in their efforts to)Tj
T*(get higher wages, and enraged beyond measure at discovering that)Tj
T*(Irishmen were to be brought in to rob their little ones of bread.)Tj
T*(Margaret knew it all; she read it in Boucher's face, forlornly)Tj
T*(desperate and livid with rage. If Mr. Thornton would but say)Tj
T*(something to them--let them hear his voice only--it seemed as if)Tj
T*(it would be better than this wild beating and raging against the)Tj
T*(stony silence that vouchsafed them no word, even of anger or)Tj

T*(was there, in face of that angry sea of men, her eyes smiting)Tj

T*(moment, and Mr. Thornton might be smitten down,--he whom she had)Tj
T*(urged and goaded to come to this perilous place. She only thought)Tj
T*(how she could save him. She threw her arms around him; she made)Tj

T*(in his unchanging attitude, looking after their retreat with)Tj
T*(defiant eyes. The moment that retreat had changed into a flight)Tj
T*(\(as it was sure from its very character to do\), he darted up the)Tj
T*(steps to Margaret. She tried to rise without his help.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is nothing,' she said, with a sickly smile. 'The skin is)Tj

T*(five minutes too late to make this vanished mob feel the power of)Tj
T*(authority and order. He hoped they would see the troops, and be)Tj
T*(quelled by the thought of their narrow escape. While these)Tj
T*(thoughts crossed his mind, Margaret clung to the doorpost to)Tj
T*(steady herself: but a film came over her eyes--he was only just)Tj
T*(in time to catch her. 'Mother--mother!' cried he; 'Come)Tj
T*(down--they are gone, and Miss Hale is hurt!' He bore her into the)Tj
T*(dining-room, and laid her on the sofa there; laid her down)Tj
T*(softly, and looking on her pure white face, the sense of what she)Tj
T*(was to him came upon him so keenly that he spoke it out in his)Tj

T*(me! Dead--cold as you lie there, you are the only woman I ever)Tj
T*(loved! Oh, Margaret--Margaret!' Inarticulately as he spoke,)Tj
T*(kneeling by her, and rather moaning than saying the words, he)Tj
T*(started up, ashamed of himself, as his mother came in. She saw)Tj
T*(nothing, but her son a little paler, a little sterner than usual.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Miss Hale is hurt, mother. A stone has grazed her temple. She)Tj
T*(has lost a good deal of blood, I'm afraid.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She looks very seriously hurt,--I could almost fancy her dead,')Tj
T*(said Mrs. Thornton, a good deal alarmed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is only a fainting-fit. She has spoken to me since.' But all)Tj
T*(the blood in his body seemed to rush inwards to his heart as he)Tj
T*(spoke, and he absolutely trembled.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Go and call Jane,--she can find me the things I want; and do you)Tj
T*(go to your Irish people, who are crying and shouting as if they)Tj
T*(were mad with fright.' He went. He went away as if weights were)Tj
T*(tied to every limb that bore him from her. He called Jane; he)Tj
T*(called his sister. She should have all womanly care, all gentle)Tj
T*(tendance. But every pulse beat in him as he remembered how she)Tj
T*(had come down and placed herself in foremost danger,--could it be)Tj
T*(to save him? At the time, he had pushed her aside, and spoken)Tj
T*(gruffly; he had seen nothing but the unnecessary danger she had)Tj
T*(placed herself in. He went to his Irish people, with every nerve)Tj
T*(in his body thrilling at the thought of her, and found it)Tj
T*(difficult to understand enough of what they were saying to soothe)Tj
T*(and comfort away their fears. There, they declared, they would)Tj
T*(not stop; they claimed to be sent back. And so he had to think,)Tj
T*(and talk, and reason.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton bathed Margaret's temples with eau de Cologne. As)Tj
T*(the spirit touched the wound, which till then neither Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton nor Jane had perceived, Margaret opened her eyes; but it)Tj
T*(was evident she did not know where she was, nor who they were.)Tj
T*(The dark circles deepened, the lips quivered and contracted, and)Tj
T*(she became insensible once more.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She has had a terrible blow,' said Mrs. Thornton. 'Is there any)Tj
T*(one who will go for a doctor?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not me, ma'am, if you please,' said Jane, shrinking back. 'Them)Tj
T*(rabble may be all about; I don't think the cut is so deep, ma'am,)Tj

T*('Oh, dear, dear!' said Fanny, crying, and preparing to go down)Tj
T*(rather than be left alone, with the thought of wounds and)Tj
T*(bloodshed in the very house.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, Jane!' said she, creeping into the dining-room, 'what is the)Tj

T*(stones into the drawing-room?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret did indeed look white and wan, although her senses were)Tj
T*(beginning to return to her. But the sickly daze of the swoon made)Tj
T*(her still miserably faint. She was conscious of movement around)Tj
T*(her, and of refreshment from the eau de Cologne, and a craving)Tj
T*(for the bathing to go on without intermission; but when they)Tj
T*(stopped to talk, she could no more have opened her eyes, or)Tj

T*(death-like trance can move, or utter sound, to arrest the awful)Tj
T*(preparations for their burial, while they are yet fully aware,)Tj
T*(not merely of the actions of those around them, but of the idea)Tj

T*(with his back to the door, apparently absorbed in watching)Tj
T*(something in the street. But, in truth, he was afraid of himself.)Tj
T*(His heart beat thick at the thought of her coming. He could not)Tj

T*(it had been at the time; but now the recollection of her clinging)Tj
T*(defence of him, seemed to thrill him through and through,--to)Tj
T*(melt away every resolution, all power of self-control, as if it)Tj
T*(were wax before a fire. He dreaded lest he should go forwards to)Tj
T*(meet her, with his arms held out in mute entreaty that she would)Tj
T*(come and nestle there, as she had done, all unheeded, the day)Tj
T*(before, but never unheeded again. His heart throbbed loud and)Tj
T*(quick Strong man as he was, he trembled at the anticipation of)Tj
T*(what he had to say, and how it might be received. She might)Tj
T*(droop, and flush, and flutter to his arms, as to her natural home)Tj
T*(and resting-place. One moment, he glowed with impatience at the)Tj
T*(thought that she might do this, the next, he feared a passionate)Tj
T*(rejection, the very idea of which withered up his future with so)Tj
T*(deadly a blight that he refused to think of it. He was startled)Tj
T*(by the sense of the presence of some one else in the room. He)Tj
T*(turned round. She had come in so gently, that he had never heard)Tj
T*(her; the street noises had been more distinct to his inattentive)Tj
T*(ear than her slow movements, in her soft muslin gown.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She stood by the table, not offering to sit down. Her eyelids)Tj
T*(were dropped half over her eyes; her teeth were shut, not)Tj
T*(compressed; her lips were just parted over them, allowing the)Tj
T*(white line to be seen between their curve. Her slow deep)Tj
T*(breathings dilated her thin and beautiful nostrils; it was the)Tj
T*(only motion visible on her countenance. The fine-grained skin,)Tj
T*(the oval cheek, the rich outline of her mouth, its corners deep)Tj
T*(set in dimples,--were all wan and pale to-day; the loss of their)Tj
T*(usual natural healthy colour being made more evident by the heavy)Tj
T*(shadow of the dark hair, brought down upon the temples, to hide)Tj
T*(all sign of the blow she had received. Her head, for all its)Tj
T*(drooping eyes, was thrown a little back, in the old proud)Tj
T*(attitude. Her long arms hung motion-less by her sides. Altogether)Tj
T*(she looked like some prisoner, falsely accused of a crime that)Tj
T*(she loathed and despised, and from which she was too indignant to)Tj
T*(justify herself.)Tj

T*(her, for she had an uneasy consciousness that she might be wanted)Tj
T*(at home, and yet, until now, it seemed cruel to leave the dying)Tj
T*(girl. Mrs. Hale was in the drawing-room on her daughter's return.)Tj
T*(It was one of her better days, and she was full of praises of the)Tj

T*(kind of beds as they used to do in her youth. One would think it)Tj
T*(was easy enough; there was the same kind of feathers to be had,)Tj
T*(and yet somehow, till this last night she did not know when she)Tj
T*(had had a good sound resting sleep. Mr. Hale suggested, that)Tj
T*(something of the merits of the featherbeds of former days might)Tj
T*(be attributed to the activity of youth, which gave a relish to)Tj
T*(rest; but this idea was not kindly received by his wife.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, indeed, Mr. Hale, it was those beds at Sir John's. Now,)Tj
T*(Margaret, you're young enough, and go about in the day; are the)Tj
T*(beds comfortable? I appeal to you. Do they give you a feeling of)Tj
T*(perfect repose when you lie down upon them; or rather, don't you)Tj
T*(toss about, and try in vain to find an easy position, and waken)Tj
T*(in the morning as tired as when you went to bed?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret laughed. 'To tell the truth, mamma, I've never thought)Tj
T*(about my bed at all, what kind it is. I'm so sleepy at night,)Tj
T*(that if I only lie down anywhere, I nap off directly. So I don't)Tj

T*(married,--to your Aunt Shaw's wedding; and poor little Fred was)Tj
T*(the baby then. And I know Dixon did not like changing from lady's)Tj
T*(maid to nurse, and I was afraid that if I took her near her old)Tj
T*(home, and amongst her own people, she might want to leave me. But)Tj
T*(poor baby was taken ill at Oxenham, with his teething; and, what)Tj
T*(with my being a great deal with Anna just before her marriage,)Tj
T*(and not being very strong myself, Dixon had more of the charge of)Tj

T*(she was so proud when he would turn away from every one and cling)Tj
T*(to her, that I don't believe she ever thought of leaving me)Tj
T*(again; though it was very different from what she'd been)Tj
T*(accustomed to. Poor Fred! Every body loved him. He was born with)Tj

T*(a wild, sharp sensation of love cleft his dull, thunderous)Tj
T*(feeling like lightning, even as he shaped the words expressive of)Tj
T*(hatred. His greatest comfort was in hugging his torment; and in)Tj
T*(feeling, as he had indeed said to her, that though she might)Tj
T*(despise him, contemn him, treat him with her proud sovereign)Tj
T*(indifference, he did not change one whit. She could not make him)Tj
T*(change. He loved her, and would love her; and defy her, and this)Tj
T*(miserable bodily pain.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He stood still for a moment, to make this resolution firm and)Tj
T*(clear. There was an omnibus passing--going into the country; the)Tj
T*(conductor thought he was wishing for a place, and stopped near)Tj
T*(the pavement. It was too much trouble to apologise and explain;)Tj
T*(so he mounted upon it, and was borne away,--past long rows of)Tj
T*(houses--then past detached villas with trim gardens, till they)Tj
T*(came to real country hedge-rows, and, by-and-by, to a small)Tj
T*(country town. Then every body got down; and so did Mr. Thornton,)Tj
T*(and because they walked away he did so too. He went into the)Tj
T*(fields, walking briskly, because the sharp motion relieved his)Tj
T*(mind. He could remember all about it now; the pitiful figure he)Tj
T*(must have cut; the absurd way in which he had gone and done the)Tj
T*(very thing he had so often agreed with himself in thinking would)Tj
T*(be the most foolish thing in the world; and had met with exactly)Tj
T*(the consequences which, in these wise moods, he had always)Tj
T*(fore-told were certain to follow, if he ever did make such a fool)Tj
T*(of himself. Was he bewitched by those beautiful eyes, that soft,)Tj
T*(half-open, sighing mouth which lay so close upon his shoulder)Tj
T*(only yesterday? He could not even shake off the recollection that)Tj
T*(she had been there; that her arms had been round him, once--if)Tj
T*(never again. He only caught glimpses of her; he did not)Tj
T*(understand her altogether. At one time she was so brave, and at)Tj
T*(another so timid; now so tender, and then so haughty and)Tj
T*(regal-proud. And then he thought over every time he had ever seen)Tj
T*(her once again, by way of finally forgetting her. He saw her in)Tj
T*(every dress, in every mood, and did not know which became her)Tj
T*(best. Even this morning, how magnificent she had looked,--her)Tj
T*(eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that, because she had)Tj
T*(shared his danger yesterday, she had cared for him the least!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(If Mr. Thornton was a fool in the morning, as he assured himself)Tj
T*(at least twenty times he was, he did not grow much wiser in the)Tj
T*(afternoon. All that he gained in return for his sixpenny omnibus)Tj
T*(ride, was a more vivid conviction that there never was, never)Tj
T*(could be, any one like Margaret; that she did not love him and)Tj
T*(never would; but that she--no! nor the whole world--should never)Tj
T*(hinder him from loving her. And so he returned to the little)Tj
T*(market-place, and remounted the omnibus to return to Milton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It was late in the afternoon when he was set down, near his)Tj
T*(warehouse. The accustomed places brought back the accustomed)Tj
T*(habits and trains of thought. He knew how much he had to do--more)Tj
T*(than his usual work, owing to the commotion of the day before. He)Tj
T*(had to see his brother magistrates; he had to complete the)Tj
T*(arrangements, only half made in the morning, for the comfort and)Tj
T*(safety of his newly imported Irish hands; he had to secure them)Tj
T*(from all chance of communication with the discontented)Tj
T*(work-people of Milton. Last of all, he had to go home and)Tj
T*(encounter his mother.)Tj

T*(expecting the news of her son's acceptance by Miss Hale. She had)Tj
T*(braced herself up many and many a time, at some sudden noise in)Tj
T*(the house; had caught up the half-dropped work, and begun to ply)Tj
T*(her needle diligently, though through dimmed spectacles, and with)Tj
T*(an unsteady hand! and many times had the door opened, and some)Tj
T*(indifferent person entered on some insignificant errand. Then her)Tj
T*(rigid face unstiffened from its gray frost-bound expression, and)Tj
T*(the features dropped into the relaxed look of despondency, so)Tj
T*(unusual to their sternness. She wrenched herself away from the)Tj
T*(contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought)Tj
T*(about to herself by her son's marriage; she forced her thoughts)Tj
T*(into the accustomed household grooves. The newly-married)Tj
T*(couple-to-be would need fresh household stocks of linen; and Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton had clothes-basket upon clothes-basket, full of)Tj
T*(table-cloths and napkins, brought in, and began to reckon up the)Tj
T*(store. There was some confusion between what was hers, and)Tj
T*(consequently marked G. H. T. \(for George and Hannah Thornton\),)Tj
T*(and what was her son's--bought with his money, marked with his)Tj
T*(initials. Some of those marked G. H. T. were Dutch damask of the)Tj
T*(old kind, exquisitely fine; none were like them now. Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton stood looking at them long,--they had been her pride)Tj
T*(when she was first married. Then she knit her brows, and pinched)Tj
T*(and compressed her lips tight, and carefully unpicked the G. H.)Tj
T*(She went so far as to search for the Turkey-red marking-thread to)Tj
T*(put in the new initials; but it was all used,--and she had no)Tj
T*(heart to send for any more just yet. So she looked fixedly at)Tj
T*(vacancy; a series of visions passing before her, in all of which)Tj
T*(her son was the principal, the sole object,--her son, her pride,)Tj
T*(her property. Still he did not come. Doubtless he was with Miss)Tj
T*(Hale. The new love was displacing her already from her place as)Tj
T*(first in his heart. A terrible pain--a pang of vain)Tj
T*(jealousy--shot through her: she hardly knew whether it was more)Tj
T*(physical or mental; but it forced her to sit down. In a moment,)Tj
T*(she was up again as straight as ever,--a grim smile upon her face)Tj
T*(for the first time that day, ready for the door opening, and the)Tj
T*(rejoicing triumphant one, who should never know the sore regret)Tj
T*(his mother felt at his marriage. In all this, there was little)Tj
T*(thought enough of the future daughter-in-law as an individual.)Tj
T*(She was to be John's wife. To take Mrs. Thornton's place as)Tj
T*(mistress of the house, was only one of the rich consequences)Tj
T*(which decked out the supreme glory; all household plenty and)Tj
T*(comfort, all purple and fine linen, honour, love, obedience,)Tj
T*(troops of friends, would all come as naturally as jewels on a)Tj
T*(king's robe, and be as little thought of for their separate)Tj
T*(value. To be chosen by John, would separate a kitchen-wench from)Tj
T*(the rest of the world. And Miss Hale was not so bad. If she had)Tj
T*(been a Milton lass, Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked)Tj
T*(her. She was pungent, and had taste, and spirit, and flavour in)Tj
T*(her. True, she was sadly prejudiced, and very ignorant; but that)Tj
T*(was to be expected from her southern breeding. A strange sort of)Tj
T*(mortified comparison of Fanny with her, went on in Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton's mind; and for once she spoke harshly to her daughter;)Tj
T*(abused her roundly; and then, as if by way of penance, she took)Tj
T*(up Henry's Commentaries, and tried to fix her attention on it,)Tj

T*(good to give away.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh! let me find one,' said Margaret, in the midst of her tears.)Tj
T*('Poor Bessy! I never thought I should not see her again.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why, that's another thing. This girl down-stairs wanted me to)Tj

T*(Dixon's harshness of manner might wound the poor girl. So, taking)Tj

T*(Margaret.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, ma'am, she loved yo', she loved yo', she did indeed!' And)Tj
T*(for a long time, Margaret could not get her to say anything more)Tj
T*(than this. At last, her sympathy, and Dixon's scolding, forced)Tj
T*(out a few facts. Nicholas Higgins had gone out in the morning,)Tj
T*(leaving Bessy as well as on the day before. But in an hour she)Tj
T*(was taken worse; some neighbour ran to the room where Mary was)Tj
T*(working; they did not know where to find her father; Mary had)Tj
T*(only come in a few minutes before she died.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It were a day or two ago she axed to be buried in somewhat o')Tj
T*(yourn. She were never tired o' talking o' yo'. She used to say)Tj
T*(yo' were the prettiest thing she'd ever clapped eyes on. She)Tj
T*(loved yo' dearly Her last words were, "Give her my affectionate)Tj
T*(respects; and keep father fro' drink." Yo'll come and see her,)Tj
T*(ma'am. She would ha' thought it a great compliment, I know.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret shrank a little from answering.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, perhaps I may. Yes, I will. I'll come before tea. But)Tj
T*(where's your father, Mary?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mary shook her head, and stood up to be going.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Miss Hale,' said Dixon, in a low voice, 'where's the use o' your)Tj
T*(going to see the poor thing laid out? I'd never say a word)Tj
T*(against it, if it could do the girl any good; and I wouldn't mind)Tj
T*(a bit going myself, if that would satisfy her. They've just a)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(That afternoon she walked swiftly to the Higgins's house. Mary)Tj
T*(was looking out for her, with a half-distrustful face. Margaret)Tj
T*(smiled into her eyes to re-assure her. They passed quickly through)Tj
T*(the house-place, upstairs, and into the quiet presence of the dead.)Tj
T*(Then Margaret was glad that she had come. The face, often so weary)Tj
T*(with pain, so restless with troublous thoughts, had now the faint)Tj
T*(soft smile of eternal rest upon it. The slow tears gathered into)Tj
T*(Margaret's eyes, but a deep calm entered into her soul. And that)Tj
T*(was death! It looked more peaceful than life. All beautiful)Tj
T*(scriptures came into her mind. 'They rest from their labours.')Tj
T*('The weary are at rest.' 'He giveth His beloved sleep.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Slowly, slowly Margaret turned away from the bed. Mary was humbly)Tj
T*(sobbing in the back-ground. They went down stairs without a word.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Resting his hand upon the house-table, Nicholas Higgins stood in)Tj
T*(the midst of the floor; his great eyes startled open by the news)Tj
T*(he had heard, as he came along the court, from many busy tongues.)Tj
T*(His eyes were dry and fierce; studying the reality of her death;)Tj
T*(bringing himself to understand that her place should know her no)Tj
T*(more. For she had been sickly, dying so long, that he had)Tj
T*(persuaded himself she would not die; that she would 'pull)Tj

T*(Margaret felt as if she had no business to be there, familiarly)Tj
T*(acquainting herself with the surroundings of death which he, the)Tj
T*(father, had only just learnt. There had been a pause of an)Tj
T*(instant on the steep crooked stair, when she first saw him; but)Tj
T*(now she tried to steal past his abstracted gaze, and to leave him)Tj
T*(in the solemn circle of his household misery.)Tj

T*(Mary sat down on the first chair she came to, and throwing her)Tj
T*(apron over her head, began to cry.)Tj

T*('No!' replied Margaret, standing still with the utmost patience,)Tj
T*(now she found herself perceived. It was some time before he spoke)Tj
T*(again, but he kept his hold on her arm.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('All men must die,' said he at last, with a strange sort of)Tj
T*(gravity, which first suggested to Margaret the idea that he had)Tj
T*(been drinking--not enough to intoxicate himself, but enough to)Tj
T*(make his thoughts bewildered. 'But she were younger than me.')Tj
T*(Still he pondered over the event, not looking at Margaret, though)Tj
T*(he grasped her tight. Suddenly, he looked up at her with a wild)Tj
T*(searching inquiry in his glance. 'Yo're sure and certain she's)Tj
T*(dead--not in a dwam, a faint?--she's been so before, often.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She is dead,' replied Margaret. She felt no fear in speaking to)Tj
T*(him, though he hurt her arm with his gripe, and wild gleams came)Tj
T*(across the stupidity of his eyes.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She is dead!' she said.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He looked at her still with that searching look, which seemed to)Tj
T*(fade out of his eyes as he gazed. Then he suddenly let go his)Tj
T*(hold of Margaret, and, throwing his body half across the table,)Tj
T*(he shook it and every piece of furniture in the room, with his)Tj
T*(violent sobs. Mary came trembling towards him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Get thee gone!--get thee gone!' he cried, striking wildly and)Tj
T*(blindly at her. 'What do I care for thee?' Margaret took her)Tj
T*(hand, and held it softly in hers. He tore his hair, he beat his)Tj
T*(head against the hard wood, then he lay exhausted and stupid.)Tj
T*(Still his daughter and Margaret did not move. Mary trembled from)Tj
T*(head to foot.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At last--it might have been a quarter of an hour, it might have)Tj
T*(been an hour--he lifted himself up. His eyes were swollen and)Tj
T*(bloodshot, and he seemed to have forgotten that any one was by;)Tj
T*(he scowled at the watchers when he saw them. He Shook himself)Tj
T*(heavily, gave them one more sullen look, spoke never a word, but)Tj
T*(made for the door.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, father, father!' said Mary, throwing herself upon his)Tj
T*(arm,--'not to-night! Any night but to-night. Oh, help me! he's)Tj
T*(going out to drink again! Father, I'll not leave yo'. Yo' may)Tj
T*(strike, but I'll not leave yo'. She told me last of all to keep)Tj
T*(yo' fro' drink!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But Margaret stood in the doorway, silent yet commanding. He)Tj
T*(looked up at her defyingly.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It's my own house. Stand out o' the way, wench, or I'll make)Tj
T*(yo'!' He had shaken off Mary with violence; he looked ready to)Tj
T*(strike Margaret. But she never moved a feature--never took her)Tj
T*(deep, serious eyes off him. He stared back on her with gloomy)Tj
T*(fierceness. If she had stirred hand or foot, he would have thrust)Tj
T*(her aside with even more violence than he had used to his own)Tj
T*(daughter, whose face was bleeding from her fall against a chair.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What are yo' looking at me in that way for?' asked he at last,)Tj
T*(daunted and awed by her severe calm. 'If yo' think for to keep me)Tj

T*(you ax us, the more we won't stir.' The more she tried to think)Tj
T*(of something anything besides the danger to which Frederick would)Tj
T*(be exposed--the more closely her imagination clung to the)Tj
T*(unfortunate idea presented to her. Her mother prattled with)Tj
T*(Dixon, and seemed to have utterly forgotten the possibility of)Tj
T*(Frederick being tried and executed--utterly forgotten that at her)Tj
T*(wish, if by Margaret's deed, he was summoned into this danger.)Tj
T*(Her mother was one of those who throw out terrible possibilities,)Tj
T*(miserable probabilities, unfortunate chances of all kinds, as a)Tj

T*(Mr. Hale treated all his fellow-creatures alike: it never entered)Tj
T*(into his head to make any difference because of their rank. He)Tj
T*(placed a chair for Nicholas stood up till he, at Mr. Hale's)Tj
T*(request, took a seat; and called him, invariably, 'Mr. Higgins,')Tj
T*(instead of the curt 'Nicholas' or 'Higgins,' to which the)Tj
T*('drunken infidel weaver' had been accustomed. But Nicholas was)Tj
T*(neither an habitual drunkard nor a thorough infidel. He drank to)Tj
T*(drown care, as he would have himself expressed it: and he was)Tj
T*(infidel so far as he had never yet found any form of faith to)Tj
T*(which he could attach himself, heart and soul.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret was a little surprised, and very much pleased, when she)Tj
T*(found her father and Higgins in earnest conversation--each)Tj
T*(speaking with gentle politeness to the other, however their)Tj
T*(opinions might clash. Nicholas--clean, tidied \(if only at the)Tj
T*(pump-trough\), and quiet spoken--was a new creature to her, who)Tj
T*(had only seen him in the rough independence of his own)Tj
T*(hearthstone. He had 'slicked' his hair down with the fresh water;)Tj
T*(he had adjusted his neck-handkerchief, and borrowed an odd)Tj
T*(candle-end to polish his clogs with and there he sat, enforcing)Tj
T*(some opinion on her father, with a strong Darkshire accent, it is)Tj
T*(true, but with a lowered voice, and a good, earnest composure on)Tj
T*(his face. Her father, too, was interested in what his companion)Tj
T*(was saying. He looked round as she came in, smiled, and quietly)Tj
T*(gave her his chair, and then sat down afresh as quickly as)Tj
T*(possible, and with a little bow of apology to his guest for the)Tj
T*(interruption. Higgins nodded to her as a sign of greeting; and)Tj
T*(she softly adjusted her working materials on the table, and)Tj
T*(prepared to listen.)Tj

T*(grown up with the inconsequence, so she did not perceive it. It)Tj
T*(was as follows:--)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, Margaret, it is worth a journey from England to see my boy!)Tj
T*(He is a superb little fellow, especially in his caps, and most)Tj
T*(especially in the one you sent him, you good, dainty-fingered,)Tj
T*(persevering little lady! Having made all the mothers here)Tj
T*(envious, I want to show him to somebody new, and hear a fresh set)Tj
T*(of admiring expressions; perhaps, that's all the reason; perhaps)Tj
T*(it is not--nay, possibly, there is just a little cousinly love)Tj
T*(mixed with it; but I do want you so much to come here, Margaret!)Tj
T*(I'm sure it would be the very best thing for Aunt Hale's health;)Tj
T*(everybody here is young and well, and our skies are always blue,)Tj
T*(and our sun always shines, and the band plays deliciously from)Tj
T*(morning till night; and, to come back to the burden of my ditty,)Tj
T*(my baby always smiles. I am constantly wanting you to draw him)Tj
T*(for me, Margaret. It does not signify what he is doing; that very)Tj
T*(thing is prettiest, gracefulest, best. I think I love him a great)Tj
T*(deal better than my husband, who is getting stout, and)Tj
T*(grumpy,--what he calls "busy." No! he is not. He has just come in)Tj
T*(with news of such a charming pic-nic, given by the officers of)Tj
T*(the Hazard, at anchor in the bay below. Because he has brought in)Tj
T*(such a pleasant piece of news, I retract all I said just now. Did)Tj
T*(not somebody burn his hand for having said or done something he)Tj
T*(was sorry for? Well, I can't burn mine, because it would hurt me,)Tj
T*(and the scar would be ugly; but I'll retract all I said as fast)Tj
T*(as I can. Cosmo is quite as great a darling as baby, and not a)Tj
T*(bit stout, and as un-grumpy as ever husband was; only, sometimes)Tj
T*(he is very, very busy. I may say that without love--wifely)Tj
T*(duty--where was I?--I had something very particular to say, I)Tj
T*(know, once. Oh, it is this--Dearest Margaret!--you must come and)Tj
T*(see me; it would do Aunt Hale good, as I said before. Get the)Tj
T*(doctor to order it for her. Tell him that it's the smoke of)Tj
T*(Milton that does her harm. I have no doubt it is that, really.)Tj
T*(Three months \(you must not come for less\) of this delicious)Tj
T*(climate--all sunshine, and grapes as common as blackberries,)Tj
T*(would quite cure her. I don't ask my uncle'--\(Here the letter)Tj
T*(became more constrained, and better written; Mr. Hale was in the)Tj
T*(corner, like a naughty child, for having given up his)Tj
T*(living.\)--'because, I dare say, he disapproves of war, and)Tj
T*(soldiers, and bands of music; at least, I know that many)Tj
T*(Dissenters are members of the Peace Society, and I am afraid he)Tj
T*(would not like to come; but, if he would, dear, pray say that)Tj
T*(Cosmo and I will do our best to make him happy; and I'll hide up)Tj
T*(Cosmo's red coat and sword, and make the band play all sorts of)Tj
T*(grave, solemn things; or, if they do play pomps and vanities, it)Tj
T*(shall be in double slow time. Dear Margaret, if he would like to)Tj
T*(accompany you and Aunt Hale, we will try and make it pleasant,)Tj
T*(though I'm rather afraid of any one who has done something for)Tj
T*(conscience sake. You never did, I hope. Tell Aunt Hale not to)Tj
T*(bring many warm clothes, though I'm afraid it will be late in the)Tj
T*(year before you can come. But you have no idea of the heat here!)Tj
T*(I tried to wear my great beauty Indian shawl at a pic-nic. I kept)Tj
T*(myself up with proverbs as long as I could; "Pride must)Tj
T*(abide,"--and such wholesome pieces of pith; but it was of no use.)Tj
T*(I was like mamma's little dog Tiny with an elephant's trappings)Tj
T*(on; smothered, hidden, killed with my finery; so I made it into a)Tj
T*(capital carpet for us all to sit down upon. Here's this boy of)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Mamma is accusing me of having picked up a great deal of)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The 'vulgarity' Margaret spoke of, referred purely to the use of)Tj

T*(him; so, in the natural sweet desire to avoid giving unnecessary)Tj

T*(It was unusual with Margaret to obtrude her own subject of)Tj

T*(Mr. Thornton promised that she should--conversed a little, and)Tj

T*(his next speech to any one else was modified by what she had)Tj

T*(During the time that Mrs. Thornton was having this interview with)Tj
T*(Mrs. Hale, Margaret and Dixon were laying their heads together,)Tj
T*(and consulting how they should keep Frederick's coming a profound)Tj
T*(secret to all out of the house. A letter from him might now be)Tj
T*(expected any day; and he would assuredly follow quickly on its)Tj
T*(heels. Martha must be sent away on her holiday; Dixon must keep)Tj
T*(stern guard on the front door, only admitting the few visitors)Tj
T*(that ever came to the house into Mr. Hale's room)Tj
T*(down-stairs--Mrs. Hale's extreme illness giving her a good excuse)Tj
T*(for this. If Mary Higgins was required as a help to Dixon in the)Tj
T*(kitchen she was to hear and see as little of Frederick as)Tj
T*(possible; and he was, if necessary to be spoken of to her under)Tj
T*(the name of Mr. Dickinson. But her sluggish and incurious nature)Tj
T*(was the greatest safeguard of all.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They resolved that Martha should leave them that very afternoon)Tj
T*(for this visit to her mother. Margaret wished that she had been)Tj
T*(sent away on the previous day, as she fancied it might be thought)Tj
T*(strange to give a servant a holiday when her mistress's state)Tj
T*(required so much attendance.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Poor Margaret! All that afternoon she had to act the part of a)Tj
T*(Roman daughter, and give strength out of her own scanty stock to)Tj
T*(her father. Mr. hale would hope, would not despair, between the)Tj
T*(attacks of his wife's malady; he buoyed himself up in every)Tj
T*(respite from her pain, and believed that it was the beginning of)Tj
T*(ultimate recovery. And so, when the paroxysms came on, each more)Tj
T*(severe than the last, they were fresh agonies, and greater)Tj
T*(disappointments to him. This afternoon, he sat in the)Tj
T*(drawing-room, unable to bear the solitude of his study, or to)Tj
T*(employ himself in any way. He buried his head in his arms, which)Tj
T*(lay folded on the table. Margaret's heart ached to see him; yet,)Tj
T*(as he did not speak, she did not like to volunteer any attempt at)Tj
T*(comfort. Martha was gone. Dixon sat with Mrs. Hale while she)Tj

T*(wail like a child. It was so different to all which Margaret had)Tj
T*(hoped and expected, that she turned sick with disappointment, and)Tj
T*(was silent for an instant. Then she spoke again--very)Tj
T*(differently--not so exultingly, far more tenderly and carefully.)Tj

T*('Papa, it is Frederick! Think of mamma, how glad she will be! And)Tj
T*(oh, for her sake, how glad we ought to be! For his sake,)Tj

T*(slept! She knew that she did, from the candle-lighter thrust)Tj
T*(through the keyhole of her bedroom door. The traveller could be)Tj
T*(refreshed and bright, and the first excitement of the meeting)Tj
T*(with his father all be over, before her mother became aware of)Tj
T*(anything unusual.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When all was ready, Margaret opened the study door, and went in)Tj
T*(like a serving-maiden, with a heavy tray held in her extended)Tj
T*(arms. She was proud of serving Frederick. But he, when he saw)Tj
T*(her, sprang up in a minute, and relieved her of her burden. It)Tj
T*(was a type, a sign, of all the coming relief which his presence)Tj
T*(would bring. The brother and sister arranged the table together,)Tj
T*(saying little, but their hands touching, and their eyes speaking)Tj
T*(the natural language of expression, so intelligible to those of)Tj
T*(the same blood. The fire had gone out; and Margaret applied)Tj
T*(herself to light it, for the evenings had begun to be chilly; and)Tj
T*(yet it was desirable to make all noises as distant as possible)Tj
T*(from Mrs. Hale's room.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Dixon says it is a gift to light a fire; not an art to be)Tj
T*(acquired.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Poeta nascitur, non fit,' murmured Mr. Hale; and Margaret was)Tj
T*(glad to hear a quotation once more, however languidly given.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Dear old Dixon! How we shall kiss each other!' said Frederick.)Tj
T*('She used to kiss me, and then look in my face to be sure I was)Tj
T*(the right person, and then set to again! But, Margaret, what a)Tj
T*(bungler you are! I never saw such a little awkward,)Tj
T*(good-for-nothing pair of hands. Run away, and wash them, ready to)Tj
T*(cut bread-and-butter for me, and leave the fire. I'll manage it.)Tj
T*(Lighting fires is one of my natural accomplishments.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(So Margaret went away; and returned; and passed in and out of the)Tj
T*(room, in a glad restlessness that could not be satisfied with)Tj
T*(sitting still. The more wants Frederick had, the better she was)Tj
T*(pleased; and he understood all this by instinct. It was a joy)Tj
T*(snatched in the house of mourning, and the zest of it was all the)Tj
T*(more pungent, because they knew in the depths of their hearts)Tj
T*(what irremediable sorrow awaited them.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In the middle, they heard Dixon's foot on the stairs. Mr. Hale)Tj
T*(started from his languid posture in his great armchair, from)Tj
T*(which he had been watching his children in a dreamy way, as if)Tj
T*(they were acting some drama of happiness, which it was pretty to)Tj
T*(look at, but which was distinct from reality, and in which he had)Tj
T*(no part. He stood up, and faced the door, showing such a strange,)Tj
T*(sudden anxiety to conceal Frederick from the sight of any person)Tj
T*(entering, even though it were the faithful Dixon, that a shiver)Tj
T*(came over Margaret's heart: it reminded her of the new fear in)Tj
T*(their lives. She caught at Frederick's arm, and clutched it)Tj
T*(tight, while a stern thought compressed her brows, and caused her)Tj
T*(to set her teeth. And yet they knew it was only Dixon's measured)Tj
T*(tread. They heard her walk the length of the passage, into the)Tj
T*(kitchen. Margaret rose up.)Tj
T*()Tj

T*(was told of her son's arrival. Dr. Donaldson's appointed visit)Tj
T*(would bring nervous excitement enough for the evening; and he)Tj
T*(might tell them how to prepare her for seeing Frederick. He was)Tj
T*(there, in the house; could be summoned at any moment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret could not sit still. It was a relief to her to aid Dixon)Tj
T*(in all her preparations for 'Master Frederick.' It seemed as)Tj
T*(though she never could be tired again. Each glimpse into the room)Tj
T*(where he sate by his father, conversing with him, about, she knew)Tj
T*(not what, nor cared to know,--was increase of strength to her.)Tj
T*(Her own time for talking and hearing would come at last, and she)Tj
T*(was too certain of this to feel in a hurry to grasp it now. She)Tj
T*(took in his appearance and liked it. He had delicate features,)Tj
T*(redeemed from effeminacy by the swarthiness of his complexion,)Tj
T*(and his quick intensity of expression. His eyes were generally)Tj
T*(merry-looking, but at times they and his mouth so suddenly)Tj
T*(changed, and gave her such an idea of latent passion, that it)Tj
T*(almost made her afraid. But this look was only for an instant;)Tj
T*(and had in it no doggedness, no vindictiveness; it was rather the)Tj
T*(instantaneous ferocity of expression that comes over the)Tj
T*(countenances of all natives of wild or southern countries--a)Tj
T*(ferocity which enhances the charm of the childlike softness into)Tj
T*(which such a look may melt away. Margaret might fear the violence)Tj
T*(of the impulsive nature thus occasionally betrayed, but there was)Tj
T*(nothing in it to make her distrust, or recoil in the least, from)Tj
T*(the new-found brother. On the contrary, all their intercourse was)Tj
T*(peculiarly charming to her from the very first. She knew then how)Tj
T*(much responsibility she had had to bear, from the exquisite)Tj
T*(sensation of relief which she felt in Frederick's presence. He)Tj
T*(understood his father and mother--their characters and their)Tj
T*(weaknesses, and went along with a careless freedom, which was yet)Tj
T*(most delicately careful not to hurt or wound any of their)Tj
T*(feelings. He seemed to know instinctively when a little of the)Tj
T*(natural brilliancy of his manner and conversation would not jar)Tj
T*(on the deep depression of his father, or might relieve his)Tj
T*(mother's pain. Whenever it would have been out of tune, and out)Tj
T*(of time, his patient devotion and watchfulness came into play,)Tj
T*(and made him an admirable nurse. Then Margaret was almost touched)Tj
T*(into tears by the allusions which he often made to their childish)Tj
T*(days in the New Forest; he had never forgotten her--or Helstone)Tj
T*(either--all the time he had been roaming among distant countries)Tj
T*(and foreign people. She might talk to him of the old spot, and)Tj
T*(never fear tiring him. She had been afraid of him before he came,)Tj
T*(even while she had longed for his coming; seven or eight years)Tj
T*(had, she felt, produced such great changes in herself that,)Tj
T*(forgetting how much of the original Margaret was left, she had)Tj
T*(reasoned that if her tastes and feelings had so materially)Tj
T*(altered, even in her stay-at-home life, his wild career, with)Tj
T*(which she was but imperfectly acquainted, must have almost)Tj
T*(substituted another Frederick for the tall stripling in his)Tj
T*(middy's uniform, whom she remembered looking up to with such)Tj
T*(admiring awe. But in their absence they had grown nearer to each)Tj
T*(other in age, as well as in many other things. And so it was that)Tj
T*(the weight, this sorrowful time, was lightened to Margaret. Other)Tj
T*(light than that of Frederick's presence she had none. For a few)Tj
T*(hours, the mother rallied on seeing her son. She sate with his)Tj
T*(hand in hers; she would not part with it even while she slept;)Tj
T*(and Margaret had to feed him like a baby, rather than that he)Tj
T*(should disturb her mother by removing a finger. Mrs. Hale wakened)Tj

T*(If Margaret thought Frederick's theory rather a rough one at)Tj
T*(first, she saw how he worked it out into continual production of)Tj
T*(kindness in fact. After a bad night with his mother \(for he)Tj
T*(insisted on taking his turn as a sitter-up\) he was busy next)Tj
T*(morning before breakfast, contriving a leg-rest for Dixon, who)Tj
T*(was beginning to feel the fatigues of watching. At)Tj
T*(breakfast-time, he interested Mr. Hale with vivid, graphic,)Tj
T*(rattling accounts of the wild life he had led in Mexico, South)Tj

T*(the October morning of Milton, whose silver mists were heavy)Tj

T*(he did break through and shine. Margaret went languidly about,)Tj
T*(assisting Dixon in her task of arranging the house. Her eyes were)Tj
T*(continually blinded by tears, but she had no time to give way to)Tj
T*(regular crying. The father and brother depended upon her; while)Tj
T*(they were giving way to grief, she must be working, planning,)Tj
T*(considering. Even the necessary arrangements for the funeral)Tj
T*(seemed to devolve upon her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When the fire was bright and crackling--when everything was ready)Tj
T*(for breakfast, and the tea-kettle was singing away, Margaret gave)Tj
T*(a last look round the room before going to summon Mr. Hale and)Tj
T*(Frederick. She wanted everything to look as cheerful as possible;)Tj
T*(and yet, when it did so, the contrast between it and her own)Tj
T*(thoughts forced her into sudden weeping. She was kneeling by the)Tj
T*(sofa, hiding her face in the cushions that no one might hear her)Tj
T*(cry, when she was touched on the shoulder by Dixon.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Come, Miss Hale--come, my dear! You must not give way, or where)Tj
T*(shall we all be? There is not another person in the house fit to)Tj
T*(give a direction of any kind, and there is so much to be done.)Tj
T*(There's who's to manage the funeral; and who's to come to it; and)Tj
T*(where it's to be; and all to be settled: and Master Frederick's)Tj
T*(like one crazed with crying, and master never was a good one for)Tj
T*(settling; and, poor gentleman, he goes about now as if he was)Tj
T*(lost. It's bad enough, my dear, I know; but death comes to us)Tj
T*(all; and you're well off never to have lost any friend till)Tj
T*(now. 'Perhaps so. But this seemed a loss by itself; not to bear)Tj
T*(comparison with any other event in the world. Margaret did not)Tj
T*(take any comfort from what Dixon said, but the unusual tenderness)Tj
T*(of the prim old servant's manner touched her to the heart; and,)Tj
T*(more from a desire to show her gratitude for this than for any)Tj
T*(other reason, she roused herself up, and smiled in answer to)Tj
T*(Dixon's anxious look at her; and went to tell her father and)Tj
T*(brother that breakfast was ready.)Tj

T*(Mr. Hale came--as if in a dream, or rather with the unconscious)Tj
T*(motion of a sleep-walker, whose eyes and mind perceive other)Tj
T*(things than what are present. Frederick came briskly in, with a)Tj
T*(forced cheerfulness, grasped her hand, looked into her eyes, and)Tj
T*(burst into tears. She had to try and think of little nothings to)Tj
T*(say all breakfast-time, in order to prevent the recurrence of her)Tj
T*(companions' thoughts too strongly to the last meal they had taken)Tj
T*(together, when there had been a continual strained listening for)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(After breakfast, she resolved to speak to her father, about the)Tj
T*(funeral. He shook his head, and assented to all she proposed,)Tj

T*('I've done it, miss. I was really afraid for master, that he'd)Tj
T*(have a stroke with grief. He's been all this day with poor)Tj
T*(missus; and when I've listened at the door, I've heard him)Tj
T*(talking to her, and talking to her, as if she was alive. When I)Tj
T*(went in he would be quite quiet, but all in a maze like. So I)Tj
T*(thought to myself, he ought to be roused; and if it gives him a)Tj
T*(shock at first, it will, maybe, be the better afterwards. So I've)Tj
T*(been and told him, that I don't think it's safe for Master)Tj
T*(Frederick to be here. And I don't. It was only on Tuesday, when I)Tj
T*(was out, that I met-a Southampton man--the first I've seen since)Tj
T*(I came to Milton; they don't make their way much up here, I)Tj
T*(think. Well, it was young Leonards, old Leonards the draper's)Tj
T*(son, as great a scamp as ever lived--who plagued his father)Tj
T*(almost to death, and then ran off to sea. I never could abide)Tj
T*(him. He was in the Orion at the same time as Master Frederick, I)Tj
T*(know; though I don't recollect if he was there at the mutiny.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Did he know you?' said Margaret, eagerly.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why, that's the worst of it. I don't believe he would have known)Tj
T*(me but for my being such a fool as to call out his name. He were)Tj
T*(a Southampton man, in a strange place, or else I should never)Tj
T*(have been so ready to call cousins with him, a nasty,)Tj
T*(good-for-nothing fellow. Says he, "Miss Dixon! who would ha')Tj
T*(thought of seeing you here? But perhaps I mistake, and you're)Tj
T*(Miss Dixon no longer?" So I told him he might still address me as)Tj
T*(an unmarried lady, though if I hadn't been so particular, I'd had)Tj

T*(of being even, I asked him after his father \(who I knew had)Tj
T*(turned him out of doors\), as if they was the best friends as ever)Tj
T*(was. So then, to spite me--for you see we were getting savage,)Tj
T*(for all we were so civil to each other--he began to inquire after)Tj
T*(Master Frederick, and said, what a scrape he'd got into \(as if)Tj
T*(Master Frederick's scrapes would ever wash George Leonards')Tj
T*(white, or make 'em look otherwise than nasty, dirty black\), and)Tj
T*(how he'd be hung for mutiny if ever he were caught, and how a)Tj
T*(hundred pound reward had been offered for catching him, and what)Tj
T*(a disgrace he had been to his family--all to spite me, you see,)Tj
T*(my dear, because before now I've helped old Mr. Leonards to give)Tj
T*(George a good rating, down in Southampton. So I said, there were)Tj
T*(other families be thankful if they could think they were earning)Tj
T*(an honest living as I knew, who had far more cause to blush for)Tj
T*(their sons, and to far away from home. To which he made answer,)Tj
T*(like the impudent chap he is, that he were in a confidential)Tj
T*(situation, and if I knew of any young man who had been so)Tj
T*(unfortunate as to lead vicious courses, and wanted to turn)Tj
T*(steady, he'd have no objection to lend him his patronage. He,)Tj
T*(indeed! Why, he'd corrupt a saint. I've not felt so bad myself)Tj
T*(for years as when I were standing talking to him the other day. I)Tj
T*(could have cried to think I couldn't spite him better, for he)Tj
T*(kept smiling in my face, as if he took all my compliments for)Tj
T*(earnest; and I couldn't see that he minded what I said in the)Tj
T*(least, while I was mad with all his speeches.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But you did not tell him anything about us--about Frederick?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not I,' said Dixon. 'He had never the grace to ask where I was)Tj
T*(staying; and I shouldn't have told him if he had asked. Nor did I)Tj
T*(ask him what his precious situation was. He was waiting for a)Tj
T*(bus, and just then it drove up, and he hailed it. But, to plague)Tj
T*(me to the last, he turned back before he got in, and said, "If)Tj
T*(you can help me to trap Lieutenant Hale, Miss Dixon, we'll go)Tj
T*(partners in the reward. I know you'd like to be my partner, now)Tj
T*(wouldn't you? Don't be shy, but say yes." And he jumped on the)Tj
T*(bus, and I saw his ugly face leering at me with a wicked smile to)Tj

T*('No,' said Dixon. 'I were uneasy in my mind at knowing that bad)Tj

T*(Margaret had reason to sigh a little more before the conversation)Tj

T*(in her extreme distress at her father's leaving the Church had)Tj
T*(been so faintly expressed in his letters. She had thought it was)Tj
T*(the carelessness of a sailor; but the truth was, that even then)Tj
T*(he was himself inclined to give up the form of religion into)Tj
T*(which he had been baptised, only that his opinions were tending)Tj
T*(in exactly the opposite direction to those of his father. How)Tj

T*(whose evidence would go for very little, as they took part, or)Tj

T*('But is it not worth trying, to see how much evidence might be)Tj

T*(he was ashamed of having been so battered down by emotion; and)Tj
T*(though his sorrow for the loss of his mother was a deep real)Tj
T*(feeling, and would last out his life, it was never to be spoken)Tj
T*(of again. Margaret, not so passionate at first, was more)Tj
T*(suffering now. At times she cried a good deal; and her manner,)Tj
T*(even when speaking on indifferent things, had a mournful)Tj
T*(tenderness about it, which was deepened whenever her looks fell)Tj
T*(on Frederick, and she thought of his rapidly approaching)Tj
T*(departure. She was glad he was going, on her father's account,)Tj
T*(however much she might grieve over it on her own. The anxious)Tj
T*(terror in which Mr. Hale lived lest his son should be detected)Tj
T*(and captured, far out-weighed the pleasure he derived from his)Tj
T*(presence. The nervousness had increased since Mrs. Hale's death,)Tj
T*(probably because he dwelt upon it more exclusively. He started at)Tj
T*(every unusual sound; and was never comfortable unless Frederick)Tj
T*(sate out of the immediate view of any one entering the room.)Tj

T*('No, no! I should always be fancying some one had known him, and)Tj
T*(that he had been stopped, unless you could tell me you had seen)Tj
T*(him off. And go to the Outwood station. It is quite as near, and)Tj
T*(not so many people about. Take a cab there. There is less risk of)Tj

T*('Ten minutes past six; very nearly dark. So what will you do,)Tj

T*(Margaret was thankful when the parting was over--the parting from)Tj
T*(the dead mother and the living father. She hurried Frederick into)Tj
T*(the cab, in order to shorten a scene which she saw was so)Tj
T*(bitterly painful to her father, who would accompany his son as he)Tj

T*(his full face to the road, along which a horseman was slowly)Tj
T*(riding, just passing the very stile where they stood. Margaret)Tj
T*(bowed; her bow was stiffly returned.)Tj

T*(hold of his arm. 'Have you got your bag? Let us walk about here)Tj
T*(on the platform,' said she, a little flurried at the idea of so)Tj
T*(soon being left alone, and her bravery oozing out rather faster)Tj
T*(than she liked to acknowledge even to herself. She heard a step)Tj
T*(following them along the flags; it stopped when they stopped,)Tj
T*(looking out along the line and hearing the whizz of the coming)Tj
T*(train. They did not speak; their hearts were too full. Another)Tj
T*(moment, and the train would be here; a minute more, and he would)Tj
T*(be gone. Margaret almost repented the urgency with which she had)Tj
T*(entreated him to go to London; it was throwing more chances of)Tj
T*(detection in his way. If he had sailed for Spain by Liverpool, he)Tj
T*(might have been off in two or three hours.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Frederick turned round, right facing the lamp, where the gas)Tj

T*(In an instant--how, Margaret did not see, for everything danced)Tj
T*(before her eyes--but by some sleight of wrestling, Frederick had)Tj
T*(tripped him up, and he fell from the height of three or four)Tj
T*(feet, which the platform was elevated above the space of soft)Tj
T*(ground, by the side of the railroad. There he lay.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Run, run!' gasped Margaret. 'The train is here. It was Leonards,)Tj
T*(was it? oh, run! I will carry your bag.' And she took him by the)Tj
T*(arm to push him along with all her feeble force. A door was)Tj
T*(opened in a carriage--he jumped in; and as he leant out t say,)Tj
T*('God bless you, Margaret!' the train rushed past her; an she was)Tj
T*(left standing alone. She was so terribly sick and faint that she)Tj
T*(was thankful to be able to turn into the ladies' waiting-room,)Tj
T*(and sit down for an instant. At first she could do nothing but)Tj
T*(gasp for breath. It was such a hurry; such a sickening alarm;)Tj
T*(such a near chance. If the train had not been there at the)Tj
T*(moment, the man would have jumped up again and called for)Tj
T*(assistance to arrest him. She wondered if the man had got up: she)Tj
T*(tried to remember if she had seen him move; she wondered if he)Tj
T*(could have been seriously hurt. She ventured out; the platform)Tj
T*(was all alight, but still quite deserted; she went to the end,)Tj
T*(and looked over, somewhat fearfully. No one was there; and then)Tj
T*(she was glad she had made herself go, and inspect, for otherwise)Tj
T*(terrible thoughts would have haunted her dreams. And even as it)Tj
T*(was, she was so trembling and affrighted that she felt she could)Tj
T*(not walk home along the road, which did indeed seem lonely and)Tj

T*(She would wait till the down train passed and take her seat in)Tj

T*(Mr. Lennox was out of town; his clerk said that he would return)Tj
T*(by the following Tuesday at the latest; that he might possibly be)Tj
T*(at home on Monday. Consequently, after some consideration,)Tj
T*(Frederick had determined upon remaining in London a day or two)Tj
T*(longer. He had thought of coming down to Milton again; the)Tj
T*(temptation had been very strong; but the idea of Mr. Bell)Tj
T*(domesticated in his father's house, and the alarm he had received)Tj
T*(at the last moment at the railway station, had made him resolve)Tj
T*(to stay in London. Margaret might be assured he would take every)Tj
T*(precaution against being tracked by Leonards. Margaret was)Tj
T*(thankful that she received this letter while her father was)Tj
T*(absent in her mother's room. If he had been present, he would)Tj
T*(have expected her to read it aloud to him, and it would have)Tj
T*(raised in him a state of nervous alarm which she would have found)Tj
T*(it impossible to soothe away. There was not merely the fact,)Tj
T*(which disturbed her excessively, of Frederick's detention in)Tj
T*(London, but there were allusions to the recognition at the last)Tj
T*(moment at Milton, and the possibility of a pursuit, which made)Tj
T*(her blood run cold; and how then would it have affected her)Tj
T*(father? Many a time did Margaret repent of having suggested and)Tj
T*(urged on the plan of consulting Mr. Lennox. At the moment, it had)Tj
T*(seemed as if it would occasion so little delay--add so little to)Tj
T*(the apparently small chances of detection; and yet everything)Tj
T*(that had since occurred had tended to make it so undesirable.)Tj
T*(Margaret battled hard against this regret of hers for what could)Tj
T*(not now be helped; this self-reproach for having said what had at)Tj
T*(the time appeared to be wise, but which after events were proving)Tj
T*(to have been so foolish. But her father was in too depressed a)Tj
T*(state of mind and body to struggle healthily; he would succumb to)Tj
T*(all these causes for morbid regret over what could not be)Tj
T*(recalled. Margaret summoned up all her forces to her aid. Her)Tj
T*(father seemed to have forgotten that they had any reason to)Tj
T*(expect a letter from Frederick that morning. He was absorbed in)Tj
T*(one idea--that the last visible token of the presence of his wife)Tj
T*(was to be carried away from him, and hidden from his sight. He)Tj
T*(trembled pitifully as the undertaker's man was arranging his)Tj
T*(crape draperies around him. He looked wistfully at Margaret; and,)Tj
T*(when released, he tottered towards her, murmuring, 'Pray for me,)Tj
T*(Margaret. I have no strength left in me. I cannot pray. I give)Tj
T*(her up because I must. I try to bear it: indeed I do. I know it)Tj
T*(is God's will. But I cannot see why she died. Pray for me,)Tj

T*(confidence; and the remembrance shot through him like an agony,)Tj
T*(till it made him clench his hands tight in order to subdue the)Tj

T*(Margaret did not speak again till her hand was on the lock of the)Tj
T*(study door. Here she turned round and said, 'Take care papa does)Tj
T*(not come down. Mr. Thornton is with him now.')Tj

T*(The inspector was almost daunted by the haughtiness of her manner)Tj
T*(as she entered. There was something of indignation expressed in)Tj

T*(between Leonards and a gentleman accompanied by a lady, but heard)Tj
T*(no noise; and before the train had got to its full speed after)Tj
T*(starting, he had been almost knocked down by the headlong run of)Tj
T*(the enraged half intoxicated Leonards, swearing and cursing)Tj
T*(awfully. He had not thought any more about it, till his evidence)Tj
T*(was routed out by the inspector, who, on making some farther)Tj
T*(inquiry at the railroad station, had heard from the)Tj
T*(station-master that a young lady and gentleman had been there)Tj
T*(about that hour--the lady remarkably handsome--and said, by some)Tj
T*(grocer's assistant present at the time, to be a Miss Hale, living)Tj
T*(at Crampton, whose family dealt at his shop. There was no)Tj
T*(certainty that the one lady and gentleman were identical with the)Tj
T*(other pair, but there was great probability. Leonards himself had)Tj
T*(gone, half-mad with rage and pain, to the nearest gin-palace for)Tj
T*(comfort; and his tipsy words had not been attended to by the busy)Tj
T*(waiters there; they, however, remembered his starting up and)Tj
T*(cursing himself for not having sooner thought of the electric)Tj
T*(telegraph, for some purpose unknown; and they believed that he)Tj
T*(left with the idea of going there. On his way, overcome by pain)Tj
T*(or drink, he had lain down in the road, where the police had)Tj
T*(found him and taken him to the Infirmary: there he had never)Tj
T*(recovered sufficient consciousness to give any distinct account)Tj
T*(of his fall, although once or twice he had had glimmerings of)Tj
T*(sense sufficient to make the authorities send for the nearest)Tj
T*(magistrate, in hopes that he might be able to take down the dying)Tj
T*(man's deposition of the cause of his death. But when the)Tj
T*(magistrate had come, he was rambling about being at sea, and)Tj

T*(last words were a curse on the 'Cornish trick' which had, he)Tj
T*(said, made him a hundred pounds poorer than he ought to have)Tj
T*(been. The inspector ran all this over in his mind--the vagueness)Tj
T*(of the evidence to prove that Margaret had been at the)Tj
T*(station--the unflinching, calm denial which she gave to such a)Tj
T*(supposition. She stood awaiting his next word with a composure)Tj
T*(that appeared supreme.)Tj

T*(wandering uncertainty seeking rest, but finding none--so)Tj
T*(tear-blinded were its eyes--Mr. Thornton, instead of being)Tj
T*(shocked, seemed to have passed through that very stage of thought)Tj

T*(found, which should make the dark places plain. Man of action as)Tj

T*(if--you see, it's always awkward having to do with cases of)Tj
T*(disputed identity, and one doesn't like to doubt the word of a)Tj
T*(respectable young woman unless one has strong proof to the)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('And she denied having been at the station that evening!')Tj
T*(repeated Mr. Thornton, in a low, brooding tone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, sir, twice over, as distinct as could be. I told her I)Tj
T*(should call again, but seeing you just as I was on my way back)Tj
T*(from questioning the young man who said it was her, I thought I)Tj
T*(would ask your advice, both as the magistrate who saw Leonards on)Tj
T*(his death-bed, and as the gentleman who got me my berth in the)Tj
T*(force.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You were quite right,' said Mr. Thornton. 'Don't take any steps)Tj
T*(till you have seen me again.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The young lady will expect me to call, from what I said.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I only want to delay you an hour. It's now three. Come to my)Tj
T*(warehouse at four.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Very well, sir!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(And they parted company. Mr. Thornton hurried to his warehouse,)Tj
T*(and, sternly forbidding his clerks to allow any one to interrupt)Tj
T*(him, he went his way to his own private room, and locked the)Tj
T*(door. Then he indulged himself in the torture of thinking it all)Tj
T*(over, and realising every detail. How could he have lulled)Tj
T*(himself into the unsuspicious calm in which her tearful image had)Tj
T*(mirrored itself not two hours before, till he had weakly pitied)Tj
T*(her and yearned towards her, and forgotten the savage,)Tj
T*(distrustful jealousy with which the sight of her--and that)Tj
T*(unknown to him--at such an hour--in such a place--had inspired)Tj
T*(him! How could one so pure have stooped from her decorous and)Tj
T*(noble manner of bearing! But was it decorous--was it? He hated)Tj

T*(this falsehood--how terrible must be some dread of shame to be)Tj
T*(revealed--for, after all, the provocation given by such a man as)Tj
T*(Leonards was, when excited by drinking, might, in all)Tj
T*(probability, be more than enough to justify any one who came)Tj
T*(forward to state the circumstances openly and without reserve!)Tj
T*(How creeping and deadly that fear which could bow down the)Tj
T*(truthful Margaret to falsehood! He could almost pity her. What)Tj
T*(would be the end of it? She could not have considered all she was)Tj
T*(entering upon; if there was an inquest and the young man came)Tj
T*(forward. Suddenly he started up. There should be no inquest. He)Tj
T*(would save Margaret. He would take the responsibility of)Tj
T*(preventing the inquest, the issue of which, from the uncertainty)Tj
T*(of the medical testimony \(which he had vaguely heard the night)Tj
T*(before, from the surgeon in attendance\), could be but doubtful;)Tj
T*(the doctors had discovered an internal disease far advanced, and)Tj
T*(sure to prove fatal; they had stated that death might have been)Tj
T*(accelerated by the fall, or by the subsequent drinking and)Tj
T*(exposure to cold. If he had but known how Margaret would have)Tj
T*(become involved in the affair--if he had but foreseen that she)Tj
T*(would have stained her whiteness by a falsehood, he could have)Tj
T*(saved her by a word; for the question, of inquest or no inquest,)Tj
T*(had hung trembling in the balance only the night before. Miss)Tj
T*(Hale might love another--was indifferent and contemptuous to)Tj
T*(him--but he would yet do her faithful acts of service of which)Tj
T*(she should never know. He might despise her, but the woman whom)Tj
T*(he had once loved should be kept from shame; and shame it would)Tj
T*(be to pledge herself to a lie in a public court, or otherwise to)Tj
T*(stand and acknowledge her reason for desiring darkness rather)Tj
T*(than light.)Tj

T*(Very gray and stern did Mr. Thornton look, as he passed out)Tj
T*(through his wondering clerks. He was away about half an hour; and)Tj
T*(scarcely less stern did he look when he returned, although his)Tj
T*(errand had been successful.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He wrote two lines on a slip of paper, put it in an envelope, and)Tj
T*(sealed it up. This he gave to one of the clerks, saying:--)Tj

T*('I appointed Watson--he who was a packer in the warehouse, and)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Mr. Thornton's!' said Margaret.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes! he's a magistrate--ah! here it is.' She could not see to)Tj

T*('I'm sure, ma'am, it's a great weight off my mind; for the)Tj

T*(speak.)Tj

T*('Thank you for calling. It is very late. I dare say it is past)Tj

T*(interpreting the meaning of the hand held out to receive it. He)Tj
T*(was putting it up, when she said, 'I think it is a cramped,)Tj
T*(dazzling sort of writing. I could not read it; will you just read)Tj
T*(it to me?')Tj

T*('Thank you. You told Mr. Thornton that I was not there?')Tj

T*('Oh, of course, ma'am. I'm sorry now that I acted upon)Tj

T*(young man was so positive; and now he says that he doubted all)Tj

T*(annoyance as to lose their shop your custom. Good night, ma'am.')Tj

T*('Good night.' She rang the bell for Dixon to show him out. As)Tj

T*(What had Mr. Thornton done? What were the exact words of his)Tj
T*(note? And until she could recollect, even to the placing or)Tj
T*(omitting an article, the very expressions which he had used in)Tj
T*(the note, her mind refused to go on with its progress. But the)Tj
T*(next conviction she came to was clear enough;--Mr. Thornton had)Tj
T*(seen her close to Outwood station on the fatal Thursday night,)Tj
T*(and had been told of her denial that she was there. She stood as)Tj
T*(a liar in his eyes. She was a liar. But she had no thought of)Tj
T*(penitence before God; nothing but chaos and night surrounded the)Tj
T*(one lurid fact that, in Mr. Thornton's eyes, she was degraded.)Tj
T*(She cared not to think, even to herself, of how much of excuse)Tj
T*(she might plead. That had nothing to do with Mr. Thornton; she)Tj
T*(never dreamed that he, or any one else, could find cause for)Tj
T*(suspicion in what was so natural as her accompanying her brother;)Tj
T*(but what was really false and wrong was known to him, and he had)Tj
T*(a right to judge her. 'Oh, Frederick! Frederick!' she cried,)Tj
T*('what have I not sacrificed for you!' Even when she fell asleep)Tj
T*(her thoughts were compelled to travel the same circle, only with)Tj
T*(exaggerated and monstrous circumstances of pain.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When she awoke a new idea flashed upon her with all the)Tj
T*(brightness of the morning. Mr. Thornton had learnt her falsehood)Tj
T*(before he went to the coroner; that suggested the thought, that)Tj
T*(he had possibly been influenced so to do with a view of sparing)Tj
T*(her the repetition of her denial. But she pushed this notion on)Tj
T*(one side with the sick wilfulness of a child. If it were so, she)Tj
T*(felt no gratitude to him, as it only showed her how keenly he)Tj
T*(must have seen that she was disgraced already, before he took)Tj
T*(such unwonted pains to spare her any further trial of)Tj
T*(truthfulness, which had already failed so signally. She would)Tj
T*(have gone through the whole--she would have perjured herself to)Tj
T*(save Frederick, rather--far rather--than Mr. Thornton should have)Tj
T*(had the knowledge that prompted him to interfere to save her.)Tj
T*(What ill-fate brought him in contact with the Inspector? What)Tj
T*(made him be the very magistrate sent for to receive Leonards')Tj
T*(deposition? What had Leonards said? How much of it was)Tj
T*(intelligible to Mr. Thornton, who might already, for aught she)Tj
T*(knew, be aware of the old accusation against Frederick, through)Tj
T*(their mutual friend, Mr. Bell? If so, he had striven to save the)Tj
T*(son, who came in defiance of the law to attend his mother's)Tj
T*(death-bed. And under this idea she could feel grateful--not yet,)Tj
T*(if ever she should, if his interference had been prompted by)Tj
T*(contempt. Oh! had any one such just cause to feel contempt for)Tj
T*(her? Mr. Thornton, above all people, on whom she had looked down)Tj
T*(from her imaginary heights till now! She suddenly found herself)Tj
T*(at his feet, and was strangely distressed at her fall. She shrank)Tj
T*(from following out the premises to their conclusion, and so)Tj
T*(acknowledging to herself how much she valued his respect and good)Tj
T*(opinion. Whenever this idea presented itself to her at the end of)Tj
T*(a long avenue of thoughts, she turned away from following that)Tj
T*(path--she would not believe in it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It was later than she fancied, for in the agitation of the)Tj
T*(previous night, she had forgotten to wind up her watch; and Mr.)Tj
T*(Hale had given especial orders that she was not to be disturbed)Tj
T*(by the usual awakening. By and by the door opened cautiously, and)Tj
T*(Dixon put her head in. Perceiving that Margaret was awake, she)Tj
T*(came forwards with a letter.)Tj

T*('Thank you, Dixon. How late it is!')Tj

T*(She spoke very languidly, and suffered Dixon to lay it on the)Tj
T*(counterpane before her, without putting out a hand to lake it.)Tj

T*('You want your breakfast, I'm sure. I will bring it you in a)Tj
T*(minute. Master has got the tray all ready, I know.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret did not reply; she let her go; she felt that she must be)Tj
T*(alone before she could open that letter. She opened it at last.)Tj
T*(The first thing that caught her eye was the date two days earlier)Tj
T*(than she received it. He had then written when he had promised,)Tj
T*(and their alarm might have been spared. But she would read the)Tj
T*(letter and see. It was hasty enough, but perfectly satisfactory.)Tj
T*(He had seen Henry Lennox, who knew enough of the case to shake)Tj
T*(his head over it, in the first instance, and tell him he had done)Tj
T*(a very daring thing in returning to England, with such an)Tj
T*(accusation, backed by such powerful influence, hanging over him.)Tj
T*(But when they had come to talk it over, Mr. Lennox had)Tj
T*(acknowledged that there might be some chance of his acquittal, if)Tj
T*(he could but prove his statements by credible witnesses--that in)Tj
T*(such case it might be worth while to stand his trial, otherwise)Tj
T*(it would be a great risk. He would examine--he would take every)Tj
T*(pains. 'It struck me' said Frederick, 'that your introduction,)Tj
T*(little sister of mine, went a long way. Is it so? He made many)Tj
T*(inquiries, I can assure you. He seemed a sharp, intelligent)Tj
T*(fellow, and in good practice too, to judge from the signs of)Tj
T*(business and the number of clerks about him. But these may be)Tj
T*(only lawyer's dodges. I have just caught a packet on the point of)Tj
T*(sailing--I am off in five minutes. I may have to come back to)Tj
T*(England again on this business, so keep my visit secret. I shall)Tj

T*(I'm sure--here's my cab. P.S.--What an escape that was! Take care)Tj
T*(you don't breathe of my having been--not even to the Shaws.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret turned to the envelope; it was marked 'Too late.' The)Tj
T*(letter had probably been trusted to some careless waiter, who had)Tj
T*(forgotten to post it. Oh! what slight cobwebs of chances stand)Tj
T*(between us and Temptation! Frederick had been safe, and out of)Tj
T*(England twenty, nay, thirty hours ago; and it was only about)Tj
T*(seventeen hours since she had told a falsehood to baffle pursuit,)Tj
T*(which even then would have been vain. How faithless she had been!)Tj
T*(Where now was her proud motto, 'Fais ce que dois, advienne que)Tj
T*(pourra?' If she had but dared to bravely tell the truth as)Tj
T*(regarded herself, defying them to find out what she refused to)Tj
T*(tell concerning another, how light of heart she would now have)Tj
T*(felt! Not humbled before God, as having failed in trust towards)Tj

T*(was it that he haunted her imagination so persistently? What)Tj
T*(could it be? Why did she care for what he thought, in spite of)Tj
T*(all her pride in spite of herself? She believed that she could)Tj

T*(She sprang out of bed and prayed long and earnestly. It soothed)Tj

T*(soon as she was drest. There was so slight an allusion to their)Tj

T*(without paying any attention to it. Indeed, beyond the mere fact)Tj

T*(there were more reasons against it than for it. The only one for)Tj
T*(it was the relief to herself; and against it was the thought that)Tj
T*(it would add materially to her father's nervousness, if it were)Tj
T*(indeed necessary for Frederick to come to England again; that he)Tj
T*(would dwell on the circumstance of his son's having caused the)Tj
T*(death of a man, however unwittingly and unwillingly; that this)Tj
T*(knowledge would perpetually recur to trouble him, in various)Tj
T*(shapes of exaggeration and distortion from the simple truth. And)Tj
T*(about her own great fault--he would be distressed beyond measure)Tj
T*(at her want of courage and faith, yet perpetually troubled to)Tj
T*(make excuses for her. Formerly Margaret would have come to him as)Tj

T*(show her patience, or to reward her father for his watchful care)Tj

T*(in making further inquiry from the medical men, so as to obviate)Tj
T*(any inquest being held. Oh! she was grateful! She had been)Tj
T*(cowardly and false, and had shown her cowardliness and falsehood)Tj
T*(in action that could not be recalled; but she was not ungrateful.)Tj
T*(It sent a glow to her heart, to know how she could feel towards)Tj

T*(SCOTCH BALLAD.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It was not merely that Margaret was known to Mr. Thornton to have)Tj
T*(spoken falsely,--though she imagined that for this reason only)Tj
T*(was she so turned in his opinion,--but that this falsehood of)Tj
T*(hers bore a distinct reference in his mind to some other lover.)Tj
T*(He could not forget the fond and earnest look that had passed)Tj
T*(between her and some other man--the attitude of familiar)Tj
T*(confidence, if not of positive endearment. The thought of this)Tj
T*(perpetually stung him; it was a picture before his eyes, wherever)Tj
T*(he went and whatever he was doing. In addition to this \(and he)Tj
T*(ground his teeth as he remembered it\), was the hour, dusky)Tj
T*(twilight; the place, so far away from home, and comparatively)Tj
T*(unfrequented. His nobler self had said at first, that all this)Tj
T*(last might be accidental, innocent, justifiable; but once allow)Tj
T*(her right to love and be beloved \(and had he any reason to deny)Tj
T*(her right?--had not her words been severely explicit when she)Tj
T*(cast his love away from her?\), she might easily have been)Tj
T*(beguiled into a longer walk, on to a later hour than she had)Tj
T*(anticipated. But that falsehood! which showed a fatal)Tj
T*(consciousness of something wrong, and to be concealed, which was)Tj
T*(unlike her. He did her that justice, though all the time it would)Tj
T*(have been a relief to believe her utterly unworthy of his esteem.)Tj
T*(It was this that made the misery--that he passionately loved her,)Tj
T*(and thought her, even with all her faults, more lovely and more)Tj
T*(excellent than any other woman; yet he deemed her so attached to)Tj
T*(some other man, so led away by her affection for him as to)Tj
T*(violate her truthful nature. The very falsehood that stained her,)Tj
T*(was a proof how blindly she loved another--this dark, slight,)Tj
T*(elegant, handsome man--while he himself was rough, and stern, and)Tj
T*(strongly made. He lashed himself into an agony of fierce)Tj
T*(jealousy. He thought of that look, that attitude!--how he would)Tj
T*(have laid his life at her feet for such tender glances, such fond)Tj
T*(detention! He mocked at himself, for having valued the mechanical)Tj
T*(way in which she had protected him from the fury of the mob; now)Tj
T*(he had seen how soft and bewitching she looked when with a man)Tj
T*(she really loved. He remembered, point by point, the sharpness of)Tj
T*(her words--'There was not a man in all that crowd for whom she)Tj
T*(would not have done as much, far more readily than for him.' He)Tj
T*(shared with the mob, in her desire of averting bloodshed from)Tj
T*(them; but this man, this hidden lover, shared with nobody; he had)Tj
T*(looks, words, hand-cleavings, lies, concealment, all to himself.)Tj

T*(Mr. Thornton was conscious that he had never been so irritable as)Tj

T*(asked him a question; and this consciousness hurt his pride he)Tj
T*(had always piqued himself on his self-control, and control)Tj
T*(himself he would. So the manner was subdued to a quiet)Tj

T*(The more Mrs. Thornton thought over what her son had said, in)Tj
T*(pleading for a merciful judgment for Margaret's indiscretion, the)Tj
T*(more bitterly she felt inclined towards her. She took a savage)Tj
T*(pleasure in the idea of 'speaking her mind' to her, in the guise)Tj
T*(of fulfilment of a duty. She enjoyed the thought of showing)Tj
T*(herself untouched by the 'glamour,' which she was well aware)Tj
T*(Margaret had the power of throwing over many people. She snorted)Tj
T*(scornfully over the picture of the beauty of her victim; her jet)Tj
T*(black hair, her clear smooth skin, her lucid eyes would not help)Tj

T*(Margaret was sitting alone, writing to Edith, and giving her many)Tj
T*(particulars of her mother's last days. It was a softening)Tj
T*(employment, and she had to brush away the unbidden tears as Mrs.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(She was so gentle and ladylike in her mode of reception that her)Tj
T*(visitor was somewhat daunted; and it became impossible to utter)Tj
T*(the speech, so easy of arrangement with no one to address it to.)Tj
T*(Margaret's low rich voice was softer than usual; her manner more)Tj
T*(gracious, because in her heart she was feeling very grateful to)Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton for the courteous attention of her call. She)Tj
T*(exerted herself to find subjects of interest for conversation;)Tj
T*(praised Martha, the servant whom Mrs. Thornton had found for)Tj
T*(them; had asked Edith for a little Greek air, about which she had)Tj
T*(spoken to Miss Thornton. Mrs. Thornton was fairly discomfited.)Tj
T*(Her sharp Damascus blade seemed out of place, and useless among)Tj
T*(rose-leaves. She was silent, because she was trying to task)Tj
T*(herself up to her duty At last, she stung herself into its)Tj
T*(performance by a suspicion which, in spite of all probability,)Tj
T*(she allowed to cross her mind, that all this sweetness was put on)Tj
T*(with a view of propitiating Mr. Thornton; that, somehow, the)Tj
T*(other attachment had fallen through, and that it suited Miss)Tj
T*(Hale's purpose to recall her rejected lover. Poor Margaret! there)Tj
T*(was perhaps so much truth in the suspicion as this: that Mrs.)Tj
T*(Thornton was the mother of one whose regard she valued, and)Tj
T*(feared to have lost; and this thought unconsciously added to her)Tj
T*(natural desire of pleasing one who was showing her kindness by)Tj
T*(her visit. Mrs. Thornton stood up to go, but yet she seemed to)Tj
T*(have something more to say. She cleared her throat and began:)Tj

T*(Margaret stood before her, blushing like any culprit, with her)Tj
T*(eyes dilating as she gazed at Mrs. Thornton. She thought she had)Tj
T*(come to speak to her about the falsehood she had told--that Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton had employed her to explain the danger she had exposed)Tj

T*(It was indiscreet, to say the least; many a young woman has lost)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Margaret's eyes flashed fire. This was a new idea--this was too)Tj

T*(make her feel the ludicrousness of the position in which she was)Tj
T*(left. There was nothing for it but to show herself out. She was)Tj

T*(All this time, she was hastily putting on her things to go out,)Tj
T*(only stopping from time to time to wipe her eyes, with an)Tj

T*(all her bravery.)Tj

T*(She went out, going rapidly towards the country, and trying to)Tj
T*(drown reflection by swiftness of motion.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(As she stood on the door-step, at her return, her father came up:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Good girl!' said he. 'You've been to Mrs. Boucher's. I was just)Tj
T*(meaning to go there, if I had time, before dinner.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, papa; I have not,' said Margaret, reddening. 'I never)Tj
T*(thought about her. But I will go directly after dinner; I will go)Tj
T*(while you are taking your nap.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Accordingly Margaret went. Mrs. Boucher was very ill; really)Tj
T*(ill--not merely ailing. The kind and sensible neighbour, who had)Tj
T*(come in the other day, seemed to have taken charge of everything.)Tj
T*(Some of the children were gone to the neighbours. Mary Higgins)Tj
T*(had come for the three youngest at dinner-time; and since then)Tj
T*(Nicholas had gone for the doctor. He had not come as yet; Mrs.)Tj
T*(Boucher was dying; and there was nothing to do but to wait.)Tj
T*(Margaret thought that she should like to know his opinion, and)Tj
T*(that she could not do better than go and see the Higginses in the)Tj
T*(meantime. She might then possibly hear whether Nicholas had been)Tj
T*(able to make his application to Mr. Thornton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She found Nicholas busily engaged in making a penny spin on the)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Come to me,' said Margaret, taking him off the dresser, and)Tj
T*(holding him in her arms; she held her watch to his ear, while she)Tj
T*(asked Nicholas if he had seen Mr. Thornton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The look on his face changed instantly.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ay!' said he. 'I've seen and heerd too much on him.')Tj

T*(some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart; the)Tj
T*(patience of the man, the simple generosity of the motive \(for he)Tj

T*(off her cares. In the middle of the evening, she was called down)Tj
T*(to speak to Mary Higgins; and when she came back, Mr. Hale)Tj
T*(imagined that he saw traces of tears on her cheeks. But that)Tj
T*(could not be, for she brought good news--that Higgins had got)Tj
T*(work at Mr. Thornton's mill. Her spirits were damped, at any)Tj
T*(rate, and she found it very difficult to go on talking at all,)Tj
T*(much more in the wild way that she had done. For some days her)Tj
T*(spirits varied strangely; and her father was beginning to be)Tj
T*(anxious about her, when news arrived from one or two quarters)Tj
T*(that promised some change and variety for her. Mr. Hale received)Tj
T*(a letter from Mr. Bell, in which that gentleman volunteered a)Tj
T*(visit to them; and Mr. Hale imagined that the promised society of)Tj
T*(his old Oxford friend would give as agreeable a turn to)Tj
T*(Margaret's ideas as it did to his own. Margaret tried to take an)Tj
T*(interest in what pleased her father; but she was too languid to)Tj
T*(care about any Mr. Bell, even though he were twenty times her)Tj
T*(godfather. She was more roused by a letter from Edith, full of)Tj
T*(sympathy about her aunt's death; full of details about herself,)Tj
T*(her husband, and child; and at the end saying, that as the)Tj
T*(climate did not suit, the baby, and as Mrs. Shaw was talking of)Tj
T*(returning to England, she thought it probable that Captain Lennox)Tj
T*(might sell out, and that they might all go and live again in the)Tj
T*(old Harley Street house; which, however, would seem very)Tj
T*(incomplete with-out Margaret. Margaret yearned after that old)Tj
T*(house, and the placid tranquillity of that old well-ordered,)Tj
T*(monotonous life. She had found it occasionally tiresome while it)Tj
T*(lasted; but since then she had been buffeted about, and felt so)Tj
T*(exhausted by this recent struggle with herself, that she thought)Tj
T*(that even stagnation would be a rest and a refreshment. So she)Tj
T*(began to look towards a long visit to the Lennoxes, on their)Tj
T*(return to England, as to a point--no, not of hope--but of)Tj
T*(leisure, in which she could regain her power and command over)Tj
T*(herself. At present it seemed to her as if all subjects tended)Tj
T*(towards Mr. Thornton; as if she could not for-get him with all)Tj
T*(her endeavours. If she went to see the Higginses, she heard of)Tj
T*(him there; her father had resumed their readings together, and)Tj
T*(quoted his opinions perpetually; even Mr. Bell's visit brought)Tj
T*(his tenant's name upon the tapis; for he wrote word that he)Tj
T*(believed he must be occupied some great part of his time with Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton, as a new lease was in preparation, and the terms of it)Tj

T*(Mr. Thornton had determined that he would make no inquiry of his)Tj
T*(mother as to how far she had put her project into execution of)Tj
T*(speaking to Margaret about the impropriety of her conduct. He)Tj
T*(felt pretty sure that, if this interview took place, his mother's)Tj
T*(account of what passed at it would only annoy and chagrin him,)Tj
T*(though he would all the time be aware of the colouring which it)Tj

T*(Margaret's very name mentioned; he, while he blamed her--while he)Tj

T*(in spite of himself. He dreamt of her; he dreamt she came dancing)Tj
T*(towards him with outspread arms, and with a lightness and gaiety)Tj
T*(which made him loathe her, even while it allured him. But the)Tj
T*(impression of this figure of Margaret--with all Margaret's)Tj
T*(character taken out of it, as completely as if some evil spirit)Tj
T*(had got possession of her form--was so deeply stamped upon his)Tj
T*(imagination, that when he wakened he felt hardly able to separate)Tj
T*(the Una from the Duessa; and the dislike he had to the latter)Tj
T*(seemed to envelope and disfigure the former Yet he was too proud)Tj
T*(to acknowledge his weakness by avoiding the sight of her. He)Tj

T*(was consequently past eight o'clock before he reached Mr. Hale's.)Tj
T*(Then there were business arrangements to be transacted in the)Tj

T*(note from Mr. Thornton would arrive, just at the last moment,)Tj
T*(saying that he was so much engaged that he could not come to read)Tj
T*(with Mr. Hale that evening. And though other pupils had taken)Tj
T*(more than his place as to time, no one was like his first scholar)Tj

T*(Mr. Lennox himself has no hope of hunting up the witnesses under)Tj
T*(years and years of time. No,' said she, 'that bubble was very)Tj

T*(So don't offend me by talking of being able to spare me, papa,)Tj
T*(for I assure you you can't.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But the idea of a change took root and germinated in Margaret's)Tj
T*(heart, although not in the way in which her father proposed it at)Tj
T*(first. She began to consider how desirable something of the kind)Tj
T*(would be to her father, whose spirits, always feeble, now became)Tj
T*(too frequently depressed, and whose health, though he never)Tj
T*(complained, had been seriously affected by his wife's illness and)Tj
T*(death. There were the regular hours of reading with his pupils,)Tj
T*(but that all giving and no receiving could no longer be called)Tj
T*(companion-ship, as in the old days when Mr. Thornton came to)Tj
T*(study under him. Margaret was conscious of the want under which)Tj
T*(he was suffering, unknown to himself; the want of a man's)Tj
T*(intercourse with men. At Helstone there had been perpetual)Tj
T*(occasions for an interchange of visits with neighbouring)Tj
T*(clergymen; and the poor labourers in the fields, or leisurely)Tj
T*(tramping home at eve, or tending their cattle in the forest, were)Tj
T*(always at liberty to speak or be spoken to. But in Milton every)Tj
T*(one was too busy for quiet speech, or any ripened intercourse of)Tj
T*(thought; what they said was about business, very present and)Tj
T*(actual; and when the tension of mind relating to their daily)Tj
T*(affairs was over, they sunk into fallow rest until next morning.)Tj
T*(The workman was not to be found after the day's work was done; he)Tj
T*(had gone away to some lecture, or some club, or some beer-shop,)Tj
T*(according to his degree of character. Mr. Hale thought of trying)Tj
T*(to deliver a course of lectures at some of the institutions, but)Tj
T*(he contemplated doing this so much as an effort of duty, and with)Tj
T*(so little of the genial impulse of love towards his work and its)Tj
T*(end, that Margaret was sure that it would not be well done until)Tj
T*(he could look upon it with some kind of zest.)Tj

T*(seemed to make Mr. Hale set only the higher value on it. And from)Tj
T*(what Margaret could gather of what Mr. Thornton had said, there)Tj
T*(was nothing in the cessation of his visits which could arise from)Tj
T*(any umbrage or vexation. His business affairs had become)Tj
T*(complicated during the strike, and required closer attention than)Tj
T*(he had given to them last winter. Nay, Margaret could even)Tj
T*(discover that he spoke from time to time of her, and always, as)Tj
T*(far as she could learn, in the same calm friendly way, never)Tj
T*(avoiding and never seeking any mention of her name.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She was not in spirits to raise her father's tone of mind. The)Tj
T*(dreary peacefulness of the present time had been preceded by so)Tj
T*(long a period of anxiety and care--even intermixed with)Tj
T*(storms--that her mind had lost its elasticity. She tried to find)Tj
T*(herself occupation in teaching the two younger Boucher children,)Tj
T*(and worked hard at goodness; hard, I say most truly, for her)Tj
T*(heart seemed dead to the end of all her efforts; and though she)Tj
T*(made them punctually and painfully, yet she stood as far off as)Tj
T*(ever from any cheerfulness; her life seemed still bleak and)Tj
T*(dreary. The only thing she did well, was what she did out of)Tj
T*(unconscious piety, the silent comforting and consoling of her)Tj
T*(father. Not a mood of his but what found a ready sympathiser in)Tj
T*(Margaret; not a wish of his that she did not strive to forecast,)Tj
T*(and to fulfil. They were quiet wishes to be sure, and hardly)Tj
T*(named without hesitation and apology. All the more complete and)Tj
T*(beautiful was her meek spirit of obedience. March brought the)Tj
T*(news of Frederick's marriage. He and Dolores wrote; she in)Tj
T*(Spanish-English, as was but natural, and he with little turns and)Tj
T*(inversions of words which proved how far the idioms of his)Tj
T*(bride's country were infecting him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On the receipt of Henry Lennox's letter, announcing how little)Tj
T*(hope there was of his ever clearing himself at a court-martial,)Tj
T*(in the absence of the missing witnesses, Frederick had written to)Tj
T*(Margaret a pretty vehement letter, containing his renunciation of)Tj
T*(England as his country; he wished he could unnative himself, and)Tj
T*(declared that he would not take his pardon if it were offered)Tj
T*(him, nor live in the country if he had permission to do so. All)Tj
T*(of which made Margaret cry sorely, so unnatural did it seem to)Tj
T*(her at the first opening; but on consideration, she saw rather in)Tj
T*(such expression the poignancy of the disappointment which had)Tj
T*(thus crushed his hopes; and she felt that there was nothing for)Tj
T*(it but patience. In the next letter, Frederick spoke so joyfully)Tj
T*(of the future that he had no thought for the past; and Margaret)Tj
T*(found a use in herself for the patience she had been craving for)Tj
T*(him. She would have to be patient. But the pretty, timid, girlish)Tj
T*(letters of Dolores were beginning to have a charm for both)Tj
T*(Margaret and her father. The young Spaniard was so evidently)Tj
T*(anxious to make a favourable impression upon her lover's English)Tj
T*(relations, that her feminine care peeped out at every erasure;)Tj
T*(and the letters announcing the marriage, were accompanied by a)Tj
T*(splendid black lace mantilla, chosen by Dolores herself for her)Tj
T*(unseen sister-in-law, whom Frederick had represented as a paragon)Tj
T*(of beauty, wisdom and virtue. Frederick's worldly position was)Tj
T*(raised by this marriage on to as high a level as they could)Tj
T*(desire. Barbour and Co. was one of the most extensive Spanish)Tj
T*(houses, and into it he was received as a junior partner. Margaret)Tj
T*(smiled a little, and then sighed as she remembered afresh her old)Tj
T*(tirades against trade. Here was her preux chevalier of a brother)Tj
T*(turned merchant, trader! But then she rebelled against herself,)Tj

T*(and protested silently against the confusion implied between a)Tj
T*(Spanish merchant and a Milton mill-owner. Well! trade or no)Tj
T*(trade, Frederick was very, very happy. Dolores must be charming,)Tj
T*(and the mantilla was exquisite! And then she returned to the)Tj
T*(present life.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Her father had occasionally experienced a difficulty in breathing)Tj
T*(this spring, which had for the time distressed him exceedingly.)Tj
T*(Margaret was less alarmed, as this difficulty went off completely)Tj
T*(in the intervals; but she still was so desirous of his shaking)Tj
T*(off the liability altogether, as to make her very urgent that he)Tj
T*(should accept Mr. Bell's invitation to visit him at Oxford this)Tj
T*(April. Mr. Bell's invitation included Margaret. Nay more, he)Tj
T*(wrote a special letter commanding her to come; but she felt as if)Tj
T*(it would be a greater relief to her to remain quietly at home,)Tj
T*(entirely free from any responsibility whatever, and so to rest)Tj
T*(her mind and heart in a manner which she had not been able to do)Tj
T*(for more than two years past.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When her father had driven off on his way to the railroad,)Tj
T*(Margaret felt how great and long had been the pressure on her)Tj
T*(time and her spirits. It was astonishing, almost stunning, to)Tj
T*(feel herself so much at liberty; no one depending on her for)Tj
T*(cheering care, if not for positive happiness; no invalid to plan)Tj
T*(and think for; she might be idle, and silent, and forgetful,--and)Tj
T*(what seemed worth more than all the other privileges--she might)Tj
T*(be unhappy if she liked. For months past, all her own personal)Tj
T*(cares and troubles had had to be stuffed away into a dark)Tj
T*(cupboard; but now she had leisure to take them out, and mourn)Tj
T*(over them, and study their nature, and seek the true method of)Tj
T*(subduing them into the elements of peace. All these weeks she had)Tj
T*(been conscious of their existence in a dull kind of way, though)Tj
T*(they were hidden out of sight. Now, once for all she would)Tj
T*(consider them, and appoint to each of them its right work in her)Tj
T*(life. So she sat almost motionless for hours in the drawing-room,)Tj
T*(going over the bitterness of every remembrance with an unwincing)Tj
T*(resolution. Only once she cried aloud, at the stinging thought of)Tj
T*(the faithlessness which gave birth to that abasing falsehood.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She now would not even acknowledge the force of the temptation;)Tj
T*(her plans for Frederick had all failed, and the temptation lay)Tj
T*(there a dead mockery,--a mockery which had never had life in it;)Tj
T*(the lie had been so despicably foolish, seen by the light of the)Tj
T*(ensuing events, and faith in the power of truth so infinitely the)Tj
T*(greater wisdom!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In her nervous agitation, she unconsciously opened a book of her)Tj
T*(father's that lay upon the table,--the words that caught her eye)Tj

T*(self-abasement:--)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(So she rose up, and determined at once to set to on some work)Tj
T*(which should take her out of herself. To begin with, she called)Tj
T*(in Martha, as she passed the drawing-room door in going)Tj
T*(up-stairs, and tried to find out what was below the grave,)Tj
T*(respectful, servant-like manner, which crusted over her)Tj
T*(individual character with an obedience that was almost)Tj
T*(mechanical. She found it difficult to induce Martha to speak of)Tj
T*(any of her personal interests; but at last she touched the right)Tj
T*(chord, in naming Mrs. Thornton. Martha's whole face brightened,)Tj
T*(and, on a little encouragement, out came a long story, of how her)Tj
T*(father had been in early life connected with Mrs. Thornton's)Tj
T*(husband--nay, had even been in a position to show him some)Tj
T*(kindness; what, Martha hardly knew, for it had happened when she)Tj
T*(was quite a little child; and circumstances had intervened to)Tj
T*(separate the two families until Martha was nearly grown up, when,)Tj
T*(her father having sunk lower and lower from his original)Tj
T*(occupation as clerk in a warehouse, and her mother being dead,)Tj
T*(she and her sister, to use Martha's own expression, would have)Tj
T*(been 'lost' but for Mrs. Thornton; who sought them out, and)Tj
T*(thought for them, and cared for them.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I had had the fever, and was but delicate; and Mrs. Thornton,)Tj
T*(and Mr. Thornton too, they never rested till they had nursed me)Tj
T*(up in their own house, and sent me to the sea and all. The)Tj
T*(doctors said the fever was catching, but they cared none for)Tj
T*(that--only Miss Fanny, and she went a-visiting these folk that)Tj
T*(she is going to marry into. So, though she was afraid at the)Tj
T*(time, it has all ended well.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Miss Fanny going to be married!' exclaimed Margaret.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes; and to a rich gentleman, too, only he's a deal older than)Tj
T*(she is. His name is Watson; and his mills are somewhere out beyond)Tj
T*(Hayleigh; it's a very good marriage, for all he's got such gray)Tj
T*(hair.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At this piece of information, Margaret was silent long enough for)Tj
T*(Martha to recover her propriety, and, with it, her habitual)Tj
T*(shortness of answer. She swept up the hearth, asked at what time)Tj
T*(she should prepare tea, and quitted the room with the same wooden)Tj
T*(face with which she had entered it. Margaret had to pull herself)Tj
T*(up from indulging a bad trick, which she had lately fallen into,)Tj
T*(of trying to imagine how every event that she heard of in)Tj
T*(relation to Mr. Thornton would affect him: whether he would like)Tj
T*(it or dislike it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The next day she had the little Boucher children for their)Tj
T*(lessons, and took a long walk, and ended by a visit to Mary)Tj
T*(Higgins. Somewhat to Margaret's surprise, she found Nicholas)Tj
T*(already come home from his work; the lengthening light had)Tj
T*(deceived her as to the lateness of the evening. He too seemed, by)Tj
T*(his manners, to have entered a little more on the way of)Tj

T*(the comfort of feeling that no one had been kept waiting for her;)Tj

T*(anxiously watching another person to learn whether to be grave or)Tj
T*(gay. After tea she resolved to examine a large packet of letters,)Tj
T*(and pick out those that were to be destroyed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Among them she came to four or five of Mr. Henry Lennox's,)Tj
T*(relating to Frederick's affairs; and she carefully read them over)Tj
T*(again, with the sole intention, when she began, to ascertain)Tj
T*(exactly on how fine a chance the justification of her brother)Tj
T*(hung. But when she had finished the last, and weighed the pros)Tj
T*(and cons, the little personal revelation of character contained)Tj
T*(in them forced itself on her notice. It was evident enough, from)Tj
T*(the stiffness of the wording, that Mr. Lennox had never forgotten)Tj
T*(his relation to her in any interest he might feel in the subject)Tj

T*(valuable; so she laid them carefully on one side. When this)Tj

T*(the thought of her absent father ran strangely in Margaret's head)Tj
T*(this night. She almost blamed herself for having felt her)Tj
T*(solitude \(and consequently his absence\) as a relief; but these)Tj
T*(two days had set her up afresh, with new strength and brighter)Tj
T*(hope. Plans which had lately appeared to her in the guise of)Tj

T*(which this eighteen months in Milton--to him so unspeakably)Tj
T*(precious, down to its very bitterness, which was worth all the)Tj
T*(rest of life's sweetness--would be remembered. Neither loss of)Tj
T*(father, nor loss of mother, dear as she was to Mr. Thornton,)Tj
T*(could have poisoned the remembrance of the weeks, the days, the)Tj
T*(hours, when a walk of two miles, every step of which was)Tj
T*(pleasant, as it brought him nearer and nearer to her, took him to)Tj
T*(her sweet presence--every step of which was rich, as each)Tj
T*(recurring moment that bore him away from her made him recall some)Tj
T*(fresh grace in her demeanour, or pleasant pungency in her)Tj
T*(character. Yes! whatever had happened to him, external to his)Tj
T*(relation to her, he could never have spoken of that time, when he)Tj
T*(could have seen her every day--when he had her within his grasp,)Tj
T*(as it were--as a time of suffering. It had been a royal time of)Tj
T*(luxury to him, with all its stings and contumelies, compared to)Tj
T*(the poverty that crept round and clipped the anticipation of the)Tj
T*(future down to sordid fact, and life without an atmosphere of)Tj

T*(Mrs. Thornton and Fanny were in the dining-room; the latter in a)Tj
T*(flutter of small exultation, as the maid held up one glossy)Tj
T*(material after another, to try the effect of the wedding-dresses)Tj
T*(by candlelight. Her mother really tried to sympathise with her,)Tj
T*(but could not. Neither taste nor dress were in her line of)Tj
T*(subjects, and she heartily wished that Fanny had accepted her)Tj
T*(brother's offer of having the wedding clothes provided by some)Tj
T*(first-rate London dressmaker, without the endless troublesome)Tj
T*(discussions, and unsettled wavering, that arose out of Fanny's)Tj
T*(desire to choose and superintend everything herself. Mr. Thornton)Tj
T*(was only too glad to mark his grateful approbation of any)Tj

T*(and graces, by giving her ample means for providing herself with)Tj
T*(the finery, which certainly rivalled, if it did not exceed, the)Tj
T*(lover in her estimation. When her brother and Mr. Bell came in,)Tj
T*(Fanny blushed and simpered, and fluttered over the signs of her)Tj
T*(employment, in a way which could not have failed to draw)Tj
T*(attention from any one else but Mr. Bell. If he thought about her)Tj
T*(and her silks and satins at all, it was to compare her and them)Tj

T*(Thursday, but unluckily it turns out to be one of the rare)Tj
T*(occasions when we, Plymouth Fellows, are called upon to perform)Tj
T*(any kind of duty, and I must not be absent from my post. Captain)Tj
T*(Lennox and Mr. Thornton are here. The former seems a smart,)Tj
T*(well-meaning man; and has proposed to go over to Milton, and)Tj
T*(assist you in any search for the will; of course there is none,)Tj
T*(or you would have found it by this time, if you followed my)Tj
T*(directions. Then the Captain declares he must take you and his)Tj
T*(mother-in-law home; and, in his wife's present state, I don't see)Tj
T*(how you can expect him to remain away longer than Friday.)Tj
T*(However, that Dixon of yours is trusty; and can hold her, or your)Tj
T*(own, till I come. I will put matters into the hands of my Milton)Tj
T*(attorney if there is no will; for I doubt this smart captain is)Tj
T*(no great man of business. Nevertheless, his moustachios are)Tj
T*(splendid. There will have to be a sale, so select what things you)Tj
T*(wish reserved. Or you can send a list afterwards. Now two things)Tj
T*(more, and I have done. You know, or if you don't, your poor)Tj
T*(father did, that you are to have my money and goods when I die.)Tj
T*(Not that I mean to die yet; but I name this lust to explain what)Tj
T*(is coming. These Lennoxes seem very fond of you now; and perhaps)Tj
T*(may continue to be; perhaps not. So it is best to start with a)Tj
T*(formal agreement; namely, that you are to pay them two hundred)Tj
T*(and fifty pounds a year, as long as you and they find it pleasant)Tj
T*(to live together. \(This, of course, includes Dixon; mind you)Tj
T*(don't be cajoled into paying any more for her.\) Then you won't be)Tj
T*(thrown adrift, if some day the captain wishes to have his house)Tj
T*(to himself, but you can carry yourself and your two hundred and)Tj
T*(fifty pounds off somewhere else; if, indeed, I have not claimed)Tj
T*(you to come and keep house for me first. Then as to dress, and)Tj
T*(Dixon, and personal expenses, and confectionery \(all young ladies)Tj
T*(eat confectionery till wisdom comes by age\), I shall consult some)Tj
T*(lady of my acquaintance, and see how much you will have from your)Tj
T*(father before fixing this. Now, Margaret, have you flown out)Tj
T*(before you have read this far, and wondered what right the old)Tj
T*(man has to settle your affairs for you so cavalierly? I make no)Tj
T*(doubt you have. Yet the old man has a right. He has loved your)Tj
T*(father for five and thirty years; he stood beside him on his)Tj
T*(wedding-day; he closed his eyes in death. Moreover, he is your)Tj
T*(godfather; and as he cannot do you much good spiritually, having)Tj
T*(a hidden consciousness of your superiority in such things, he)Tj
T*(would fain do you the poor good of endowing you materially. And)Tj

T*(her feet all day was excessive bodily weariness in the evening,)Tj
T*(and a better night's rest than she had had since she had heard of)Tj
T*(Mr. Hale's death.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At breakfast time the next day, she expressed her wish to go and)Tj
T*(bid one or two friends good-bye. Mrs. Shaw objected:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I am sure, my dear, you can have no friends here with whom you)Tj
T*(are sufficiently intimate to justify you in calling upon them so)Tj
T*(soon; before you have been at church.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But to-day is my only day; if Captain Lennox comes this)Tj
T*(afternoon, and if we must--if I must really go to-morrow----')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, yes; we shall go to-morrow. I am more and more convinced)Tj
T*(that this air is bad for you, and makes you look so pale and ill;)Tj
T*(besides, Edith expects us; and she may be waiting me; and you)Tj
T*(cannot be left alone, my dear, at your age. No; if you must pay)Tj
T*(these calls, I will go with you. Dixon can get us a coach, I)Tj
T*(suppose?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(So Mrs. Shaw went to take care of Margaret, and took her maid)Tj
T*(with her to, take care of the shawls and air-cushions. Margaret's)Tj
T*(face was too sad to lighten up into a smile at all this)Tj
T*(preparation for paying two visits, that she had often made by)Tj
T*(herself at all hours of the day. She was half afraid of owning)Tj
T*(that one place to which she was going was Nicholas Higgins'; all)Tj
T*(she could do was to hope her aunt would be indisposed to get out)Tj
T*(of the coach, and walk up the court, and at every breath of wind)Tj
T*(have her face slapped by wet clothes, hanging out to dry on ropes)Tj
T*(stretched from house to house.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There was a little battle in Mrs. Shaw's mind between ease and a)Tj
T*(sense of matronly propriety; but the former gained the day; and)Tj
T*(with many an injunction to Margaret to be careful of herself, and)Tj
T*(not to catch any fever, such as was always lurking in such)Tj
T*(places, her aunt permitted her to go where she had often been)Tj
T*(before without taking any precaution or requiring any permission.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Nicholas was out; only Mary and one or two of the Boucher)Tj
T*(children at home. Margaret was vexed with herself for not having)Tj
T*(timed her visit better. Mary had a very blunt intellect, although)Tj
T*(her feelings were warm and kind; and the instant she understood)Tj
T*(what Margaret's purpose was in coming to see them, she began to)Tj
T*(cry and sob with so little restraint that Margaret found it)Tj
T*(useless to say any of the thousand little things which had)Tj
T*(suggested themselves to her as she was coming along in the coach.)Tj
T*(She could only try to comfort her a little by suggesting the)Tj
T*(vague chance of their meeting again, at some possible time, in)Tj
T*(some possible place, and bid her tell her father how much she)Tj
T*(wished, if he could manage it, that he should come to see her)Tj

T*(as shown at various times and places even more than the patience)Tj
T*(with which she had endured long and wearing cares. Her)Tj
T*(countenance was blander than usual, as she greeted her; there was)Tj
T*(even a shade of tenderness in her manner, as she noticed the)Tj
T*(white, tear-swollen face, and the quiver in the voice which)Tj
T*(Margaret tried to make so steady.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Allow me to introduce my aunt, Mrs. Shaw. I am going away from)Tj
T*(Milton to-morrow; I do not know if you are aware of it; but I)Tj

T*(Mrs. Shaw looked extremely perplexed by what Margaret had said.)Tj
T*(Thanks for kindness! and apologies for failure in good manners!)Tj
T*(But Mrs. Thornton replied:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Miss Hale, I am glad you do me justice. I did no more than I)Tj

T*('With my aunt,' replied Margaret, turning towards Mrs. Shaw.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My niece will reside with me in Harley Street. She is almost)Tj
T*(like a daughter to me,' said Mrs. Shaw, looking fondly at)Tj
T*(Margaret; 'and I am glad to acknowledge my own obligation for any)Tj
T*(kindness that has been shown to her. If you and your husband ever)Tj
T*(come to town, my son and daughter, Captain and Mrs. Lennox, will,)Tj
T*(I am sure, join with me in wishing to do anything in our power to)Tj
T*(show you attention.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton thought in her own mind, that Margaret had not)Tj
T*(taken much care to enlighten her aunt as to the relationship)Tj
T*(between the Mr. and Mrs. Thornton, towards whom the fine-lady)Tj
T*(aunt was extending her soft patronage; so she answered shortly,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My husband is dead. Mr. Thornton is my son. I never go to)Tj
T*(London; so I am not likely to be able to avail myself of your)Tj
T*(polite offers.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At this instant Mr. Thornton entered the room; he had only just)Tj
T*(returned from Oxford. His mourning suit spoke of the reason that)Tj
T*(had called him there.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('John,' said his mother, 'this lady is Mrs. Shaw, Miss Hale's)Tj
T*(aunt. I am sorry to say, that Miss Hale's call is to wish us)Tj

T*('You are going then!' said he, in a low voice.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes,' said Margaret. 'We leave to-morrow.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My son-in-law comes this evening to escort us,' said Mrs. Shaw.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Thornton turned away. He had not sat down, and now he seemed)Tj
T*(to be examining something on the table, almost as if he had)Tj
T*(discovered an unopened letter, which had made him forget the)Tj
T*(present company. He did not even seem to be aware when they got)Tj
T*(up to take leave. He started forwards, however, to hand Mrs. Shaw)Tj
T*(down to the carriage. As it drove up, he and Margaret stood close)Tj
T*(together on the door-step, and it was impossible but that the)Tj
T*(recollection of the day of the riot should force itself into both)Tj
T*(their minds. Into his it came associated with the speeches of the)Tj
T*(following day; her passionate declaration that there was not a)Tj
T*(man in all that violent and desperate crowd, for whom she did not)Tj
T*(care as much as for him. And at the remembrance of her taunting)Tj
T*(words, his brow grew stern, though his heart beat thick with)Tj
T*(longing love. 'No!' said he, 'I put it to the touch once, and I)Tj
T*(lost it all. Let her go,--with her stony heart, and her)Tj
T*(beauty;--how set and terrible her look is now, for all her)Tj
T*(loveliness of feature! She is afraid I shall speak what will)Tj

T*(And there was no tone of regret, or emotion of any kind in the)Tj

T*(Mr. Thornton again that day. He was busily engaged; or so he)Tj
T*(said.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret's strength was so utterly exhausted by these visits,)Tj
T*(that she had to submit to much watching, and petting, and sighing)Tj
T*('I-told-you-so's,' from her aunt. Dixon said she was quite as bad)Tj
T*(as she had been on the first day she heard of her father's death;)Tj
T*(and she and Mrs. Shaw consulted as to the desirableness of)Tj
T*(delaying the morrow's journey. But when her aunt reluctantly)Tj
T*(proposed a few days' delay to Margaret, the latter writhed her)Tj
T*(body as if in acute suffering, and said:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh! let us go. I cannot be patient here. I shall not get well)Tj
T*(here. I want to forget.')Tj

T*(So the arrangements went on; and Captain Lennox came, and with)Tj

T*(indifferent, careless conversation of one who, however kind, was)Tj
T*(not too warm and anxious a sympathiser, did her good. She roused)Tj

T*(It was very well for Margaret that the extreme quiet of the)Tj
T*(Harley Street house, during Edith's recovery from her)Tj
T*(confinement, gave her the natural rest which she needed. It gave)Tj
T*(her time to comprehend the sudden change which had taken place in)Tj
T*(her circumstances within the last two months. She found herself)Tj
T*(at once an inmate of a luxurious house, where the bare knowledge)Tj
T*(of the existence of every trouble or care seemed scarcely to have)Tj
T*(penetrated. The wheels of the machinery of daily life were well)Tj
T*(oiled, and went along with delicious smoothness. Mrs. Shaw and)Tj
T*(Edith could hardly make enough of Margaret, on her return to what)Tj
T*(they persisted in calling her home. And she felt that it was)Tj
T*(almost ungrateful in her to have a secret feeling that the)Tj
T*(Helstone vicarage--nay, even the poor little house at Milton,)Tj
T*(with her anxious father and her invalid mother, and all the small)Tj
T*(household cares of comparative poverty, composed her idea of)Tj
T*(home. Edith was impatient to get well, in order to fill)Tj
T*(Margaret's bed-room with all the soft comforts, and pretty)Tj
T*(nick-knacks, with which her own abounded. Mrs. Shaw and her maid)Tj
T*(found plenty of occupation in restoring Margaret's wardrobe to a)Tj
T*(state of elegant variety. Captain Lennox was easy, kind, and)Tj
T*(gentlemanly; sate with his wife in her dressing-room an hour or)Tj
T*(two every day; played with his little boy for another hour, and)Tj
T*(lounged away the rest of his time at his club, when he was not)Tj

T*(her necessity for quiet and repose--before she had begun to feel)Tj
T*(her life wanting and dull--Edith came down-stairs and resumed her)Tj
T*(usual part in the household; and Margaret fell into the old habit)Tj
T*(of watching, and admiring, and ministering to her cousin. She)Tj
T*(gladly took all charge of the semblances of duties off Edith's)Tj
T*(hands; answered notes, reminded her of engagements, tended her)Tj

T*(often left alone. Then her thoughts went back to Milton, with a)Tj
T*(strange sense of the contrast between the life there, and here.)Tj
T*(She was getting surfeited of the eventless ease in which no)Tj
T*(struggle or endeavour was required. She was afraid lest she)Tj
T*(should even become sleepily deadened into forgetfulness of)Tj
T*(anything beyond the life which was lapping her round with luxury.)Tj
T*(There might be toilers and moilers there in London, but she never)Tj
T*(saw them; the very servants lived in an underground world of)Tj
T*(their own, of which she knew neither the hopes nor the fears;)Tj
T*(they only seemed to start into existence when some want or whim)Tj
T*(of their master and mistress needed them. There was a strange)Tj
T*(unsatisfied vacuum in Margaret's heart and mode of life; and,)Tj
T*(once when she had dimly hinted this to Edith, the latter, wearied)Tj
T*(with dancing the night before, languidly stroked Margaret's cheek)Tj
T*(as she sat by her in the old attitude,--she on a footstool by the)Tj
T*(sofa where Edith lay.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Poor child!' said Edith. 'It is a little sad for you to be left,)Tj
T*(night after night, just at this time when all the world is so)Tj
T*(gay. But we shall be having our dinner-parties soon--as soon as)Tj
T*(Henry comes back from circuit--and then there will be a little)Tj
T*(pleasant variety for you. No wonder it is moped, poor darling!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret did not feel as if the dinner-parties would be a)Tj
T*(panacea. But Edith piqued herself on her dinner-parties; 'so)Tj
T*(different,' as she said, 'from the old dowager dinners under)Tj
T*(mamma's regime;' and Mrs. Shaw herself seemed to take exactly the)Tj
T*(same kind of pleasure in the very different arrangements and)Tj
T*(circle of acquaintances which were to Captain and Mrs. Lennox's)Tj
T*(taste, as she did in the more formal and ponderous entertainments)Tj
T*(which she herself used to give. Captain Lennox was always)Tj
T*(extremely kind and brotherly to Margaret. She was really very)Tj
T*(fond of him, excepting when he was anxiously attentive to Edith's)Tj
T*(dress and appearance, with a view to her beauty making a)Tj
T*(sufficient impression on the world. Then all the latent Vashti in)Tj
T*(Margaret was roused, and she could hardly keep herself from)Tj
T*(expressing her feelings.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The course of Margaret's day was this; a quiet hour or two before)Tj
T*(a late breakfast; an unpunctual meal, lazily eaten by weary and)Tj
T*(half-awake people, but yet at which, in all its dragged-out)Tj
T*(length, she was expected to be present, because, directly)Tj
T*(afterwards, came a discussion of plans, at which, although they)Tj
T*(none of them concerned her, she was expected to give her)Tj
T*(sympathy, if she could not assist with her advice; an endless)Tj
T*(number of notes to write, which Edith invariably left to her,)Tj
T*(with many caressing compliments as to her eloquence du billet; a)Tj
T*(little play with Sholto as he returned from his morning's walk;)Tj
T*(besides the care of the children during the servants' dinner; a)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I believe I shall stay and see my brother and sister,' said Mr.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Don't go yet, please, Mr. Bell,' said she, hastily. 'I want you)Tj

T*(and saw the confusion stirring in her countenance; he sate down)Tj
T*(again, as if her little touch had been possessed of resistless)Tj
T*(strength.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You see how she overpowers me, Mr. Lennox,' said he. 'And I hope)Tj
T*(you noticed the happy choice of her expressions; she wants me to)Tj
T*("see" this cousin Edith, who, I am told, is a great beauty; but)Tj
T*(she has the honesty to change her word when she comes to me--Mrs.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(He joked, to give her time to recover from the slight flutter)Tj

T*(she caught the tone, and threw the ball back. Mr. Lennox wondered)Tj
T*(how his brother, the Captain, could have reported her as having)Tj
T*(lost all her good looks. To be sure, in her quiet black dress,)Tj
T*(she was a contrast to Edith, dancing in her white crape mourning,)Tj
T*(and long floating golden hair, all softness and glitter. She)Tj

T*(W. S. LANDOR.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The idea of Helstone had been suggested to Mr. Bell's waking mind)Tj
T*(by his conversation with Mr. Lennox, and all night long it ran)Tj
T*(riot through his dreams. He was again the tutor in the college)Tj
T*(where he now held the rank of Fellow; it was again a long)Tj
T*(vacation, and he was staying with his newly married friend, the)Tj
T*(proud husband, and happy Vicar of Helstone. Over babbling brooks)Tj
T*(they took impossible leaps, which seemed to keep them whole days)Tj
T*(suspended in the air. Time and space were not, though all other)Tj
T*(things seemed real. Every event was measured by the emotions of)Tj
T*(the mind, not by its actual existence, for existence it had none.)Tj
T*(But the trees were gorgeous in their autumnal leafiness--the warm)Tj
T*(odours of flower and herb came sweet upon the sense--the young)Tj
T*(wife moved about her house with just that mixture of annoyance at)Tj
T*(her position, as regarded wealth, with pride in her handsome and)Tj
T*(devoted husband, which Mr. Bell had noticed in real life a)Tj
T*(quarter of a century ago. The dream was so like life that, when)Tj
T*(he awoke, his present life seemed like a dream. Where was he? In)Tj
T*(the close, handsomely furnished room of a London hotel! Where)Tj
T*(were those who spoke to him, moved around him, touched him, not)Tj
T*(an instant ago? Dead! buried! lost for evermore, as far as)Tj
T*(earth's for evermore would extend. He was an old man, so lately)Tj
T*(exultant in the full strength of manhood. The utter loneliness of)Tj
T*(his life was insupportable to think about. He got up hastily, and)Tj
T*(tried to forget what never more might be, in a hurried dressing)Tj
T*(for the breakfast in Harley Street.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He could not attend to all the lawyer's details, which, as he)Tj
T*(saw, made Margaret's eyes dilate, and her lips grow pale, as one)Tj
T*(by one fate decreed, or so it seemed, every morsel of evidence)Tj
T*(which would exonerate Frederick, should fall from beneath her)Tj
T*(feet and disappear. Even Mr. Lennox's well-regulated professional)Tj
T*(voice took a softer, tenderer tone, as he drew near to the)Tj
T*(extinction of the last hope. It was not that Margaret had not)Tj
T*(been perfectly aware of the result before. It was only that the)Tj
T*(details of each successive disappointment came with such)Tj
T*(relentless minuteness to quench all hope, that she at last fairly)Tj
T*(gave way to tears. Mr. Lennox stopped reading.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I had better not go on,' said he, in a concerned voice. 'It was)Tj
T*(a foolish proposal of mine. Lieutenant Hale,' and even this)Tj
T*(giving him the title of the service from which he had so harshly)Tj
T*(been expelled, was soothing to Margaret, 'Lieutenant Hale is)Tj
T*(happy now; more secure in fortune and future prospects than he)Tj
T*(could ever have been in the navy; and has, doubtless, adopted his)Tj
T*(wife's country as his own.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That is it,' said Margaret. 'It seems so selfish in me to regret)Tj
T*(it,' trying to smile, 'and yet he is lost to me, and I am so)Tj
T*(lonely.' Mr. Lennox turned over his papers, and wished that he)Tj
T*(were as rich and prosperous as he believed he should be some day.)Tj
T*(Mr. Bell blew his nose, but, otherwise, he also kept silence; and)Tj
T*(Margaret, in a minute or two, had apparently recovered her usual)Tj
T*(composure. She thanked Mr. Lennox very courteously for his)Tj
T*(trouble; all the more courteously and graciously because she was)Tj
T*(conscious that, by her behaviour, he might have probably been led)Tj
T*(to imagine that he had given her needless pain. Yet it was pain)Tj
T*(she would not have been without.)Tj

T*(In spirit then our bliss we found,)Tj

T*(UHLAND.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret was ready long before the appointed time, and had)Tj
T*(leisure enough to cry a little, quietly, when unobserved, and to)Tj
T*(smile brightly when any one looked at her. Her last alarm was)Tj
T*(lest they should be too late and miss the train; but no! they)Tj
T*(were all in time; and she breathed freely and happily at length,)Tj
T*(seated in the carriage opposite to Mr. Bell, and whirling away)Tj
T*(past the well-known stations; seeing the old south country-towns)Tj
T*(and hamlets sleeping in the warm light of the pure sun, which)Tj
T*(gave a yet ruddier colour to their tiled roofs, so different to)Tj
T*(the cold slates of the north. Broods of pigeons hovered around)Tj
T*(these peaked quaint gables, slowly settling here and there, and)Tj
T*(ruffling their soft, shiny feathers, as if exposing every fibre)Tj
T*(to the delicious warmth. There were few people about at the)Tj
T*(stations, it almost seemed as if they were too lazily content to)Tj
T*(wish to travel; none of the bustle and stir that Margaret had)Tj
T*(noticed in her two journeys on the London and North-Western line.)Tj
T*(Later on in the year, this line of railway should be stirring and)Tj
T*(alive with rich pleasure-seekers; but as to the constant going to)Tj
T*(and fro of busy trades-people it would always be widely different)Tj
T*(from the northern lines. Here a spectator or two stood lounging)Tj
T*(at nearly every station, with his hands in his pockets, so)Tj
T*(absorbed in the simple act of watching, that it made the)Tj
T*(travellers wonder what he could find to do when the train whirled)Tj
T*(away, and only the blank of a railway, some sheds, and a distant)Tj
T*(field or two were left for him to gaze upon. The hot air danced)Tj
T*(over the golden stillness of the land, farm after farm was left)Tj
T*(behind, each reminding Margaret of German Idyls--of Herman and)Tj
T*(Dorothea--of Evangeline. From this waking dream she was roused.)Tj
T*(It was the place to leave the train and take the fly to Helstone.)Tj
T*(And now sharper feelings came shooting through her heart, whether)Tj
T*(pain or pleasure she could hardly tell. Every mile was redolent)Tj
T*(of associations, which she would not have missed for the world,)Tj
T*(but each of which made her cry upon 'the days that are no more,')Tj
T*(with ineffable longing. The last time she had passed along this)Tj
T*(road was when she had left it with her father and mother--the)Tj
T*(day, the season, had been gloomy, and she herself hopeless, but)Tj
T*(they were there with her. Now she was alone, an orphan, and they,)Tj
T*(strangely, had gone away from her, and vanished from the face of)Tj
T*(the earth. It hurt her to see the Helstone road so flooded in the)Tj
T*(sun-light, and every turn and every familiar tree so precisely)Tj
T*(the same in its summer glory as it had been in former years.)Tj
T*(Nature felt no change, and was ever young.)Tj

T*(Mr. Bell knew something of what would be passing through her)Tj
T*(mind, and wisely and kindly held his tongue. They drove up to the)Tj

T*(from the road, as much as to say, that the host did not so depend)Tj
T*(on the custom of travellers, as to have to court it by any)Tj
T*(obtrusiveness; they, rather, must seek him out. The house fronted)Tj
T*(the village green; and right before it stood an immemorial)Tj
T*(lime-tree benched all round, in some hidden recesses of whose)Tj
T*(leafy wealth hung the grim escutcheon of the Lennards. The door)Tj

T*(apologised for her coming having been so delayed, by saying, that)Tj

T*('Why, bless me!' exclaimed she, as at the end of her apology, a)Tj

T*(in that shady parlour. 'It's Miss Hale, Jenny,' said she, running)Tj
T*(to the door, and calling to her daughter. 'Come here, come)Tj
T*(directly, it's Miss Hale!' And then she went up to Margaret, and)Tj
T*(shook her hands with motherly fondness.)Tj

T*('And how are you all? How's the Vicar and Miss Dixon? The Vicar)Tj
T*(above all! God bless him! We've never ceased to be sorry that he)Tj

T*(Margaret tried to speak and tell her of her father's death; of)Tj
T*(her mother's it was evident that Mrs. Purkis was aware, from her)Tj
T*(omission of her name. But she choked in the effort, and could)Tj
T*(only touch her deep mourning, and say the one word, 'Papa.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Surely, sir, it's never so!' said Mrs. Purkis, turning to Mr.)Tj
T*(Bell for confirmation of the sad suspicion that now entered her)Tj
T*(mind. 'There was a gentleman here in the spring--it might have)Tj
T*(been as long ago as last winter--who told us a deal of Mr. Hale)Tj
T*(and Miss Margaret; and he said Mrs. Hale was gone, poor lady. But)Tj
T*(never a word of the Vicar's being ailing!')Tj

T*('It is so, however,' said Mr. Bell. 'He died quite suddenly, when)Tj
T*(on a visit to me at Oxford. He was a good man, Mrs. Purkis, and)Tj
T*(there's many of us that might be thankful to have as calm an end)Tj
T*(as his. Come Margaret, my dear! Her father was my oldest friend,)Tj
T*(and she's my god-daughter, so I thought we would just come down)Tj

T*(comfortable rooms and a capital dinner. You don't remember me I)Tj

T*(can take off your bonnet, and wash your face. It's only this very)Tj
T*(morning I plunged some fresh-gathered roses head downward in the)Tj
T*(water-jug, for, thought I, perhaps some one will be coming, and)Tj

T*('Seven. Look here! we are throwing out a window to the road on)Tj
T*(this side. Mr. Hepworth is spending an immense deal of money on)Tj
T*(this house; but really it was scarcely habitable when we)Tj
T*(came--for so large a family as ours I mean, of course.' Every)Tj
T*(room in the house was changed, besides the one of which Mrs.)Tj
T*(Hepworth spoke, which had been Mr. Hale's study formerly; and)Tj
T*(where the green gloom and delicious quiet of the place had)Tj
T*(conduced, as he had said, to a habit of meditation, but, perhaps,)Tj
T*(in some degree to the formation of a character more fitted for)Tj
T*(thought than action. The new window gave a view of the road, and)Tj
T*(had many advantages, as Mrs. Hepworth pointed out. From it the)Tj
T*(wandering sheep of her husband's flock might be seen, who)Tj
T*(straggled to the tempting beer-house, unobserved as they might)Tj
T*(hope, but not unobserved in reality; for the active Vicar kept)Tj
T*(his eye on the road, even during the composition of his most)Tj
T*(orthodox sermons, and had a hat and stick hanging ready at hand)Tj
T*(to seize, before sallying out after his parishioners, who had)Tj
T*(need of quick legs if they could take refuge in the 'Jolly)Tj
T*(Forester' before the teetotal Vicar had arrested them. The whole)Tj
T*(family were quick, brisk, loud-talking, kind-hearted, and not)Tj
T*(troubled with much delicacy of perception. Margaret feared that)Tj
T*(Mrs. Hepworth would find out that Mr. Bell was playing upon her,)Tj
T*(in the admiration he thought fit to express for everything that)Tj
T*(especially grated on his taste. But no! she took it all)Tj
T*(literally, and with such good faith, that Margaret could not help)Tj
T*(remonstrating with him as they walked slowly away from the)Tj
T*(parsonage back to their inn.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Don't scold, Margaret. It was all because of you. If she had not)Tj
T*(shown you every change with such evident exultation in their)Tj
T*(superior sense, in perceiving what an improvement this and that)Tj
T*(would be, I could have behaved well. But if you must go on)Tj
T*(preaching, keep it till after dinner, when it will send me to)Tj
T*(sleep, and help my digestion.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They were both of them tired, and Margaret herself so much so,)Tj
T*(that she was unwilling to go out as she had proposed to do, and)Tj
T*(have another ramble among the woods and fields so close to the)Tj
T*(home of her childhood. And, somehow, this visit to Helstone had)Tj
T*(not been all--had not been exactly what she had expected. There)Tj
T*(was change everywhere; slight, yet pervading all. Households were)Tj
T*(changed by absence, or death, or marriage, or the natural)Tj
T*(mutations brought by days and months and years, which carry us on)Tj
T*(imperceptibly from childhood to youth, and thence through manhood)Tj
T*(to age, whence we drop like fruit, fully ripe, into the quiet)Tj
T*(mother earth. Places were changed--a tree gone here, a bough)Tj
T*(there, bringing in a long ray of light where no light was)Tj
T*(before--a road was trimmed and narrowed, and the green straggling)Tj
T*(pathway by its side enclosed and cultivated. A great improvement)Tj
T*(it was called; but Margaret sighed over the old picturesqueness,)Tj
T*(the old gloom, and the grassy wayside of former days. She sate by)Tj
T*(the window on the little settle, sadly gazing out upon the)Tj
T*(gathering shades of night, which harmonised well with her pensive)Tj
T*(thought. Mr. Bell slept soundly, after his unusual exercise)Tj
T*(through the day. At last he was roused by the entrance of the)Tj
T*(tea-tray, brought in by a flushed-looking country-girl, who had)Tj
T*(evidently been finding some variety from her usual occupation of)Tj
T*(waiter, in assisting this day in the hayfield.)Tj

T*(in such a doleful attitude, with her hands clasped straight out)Tj

T*('I want to tell you of something I did that was very wrong, about)Tj
T*(that time,' said Margaret, suddenly looking up at him with her)Tj
T*(clear honest eyes. 'I told a lie;' and her face became scarlet.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('True, that was bad I own; not but what I have told a pretty)Tj
T*(round number in my life, not all in downright words, as I suppose)Tj
T*(you did, but in actions, or in some shabby circumlocutory way,)Tj
T*(leading people either to disbelieve the truth, or believe a)Tj
T*(falsehood. You know who is the father of lies, Margaret? Well! a)Tj
T*(great number of folk, thinking themselves very good, have odd)Tj

T*(cousins-once-removed. The tainting blood of falsehood runs)Tj

T*(ends in this way. I dare say you have been sorry for it, and that)Tj
T*(you won't do it again, and it's long ago now, and in short I want)Tj

T*(Dixon met some one in Milton--a man called Leonards--who had)Tj

T*(hurry off Fred to London, where, as you would understand from)Tj
T*(what we said the other night, he was to go to consult Mr. Lennox)Tj
T*(as to his chances if he stood the trial. So we--that is, he and)Tj
T*(I,--went to the railway station; it was one evening, and it was)Tj
T*(just getting rather dusk, but still light enough to recognise and)Tj
T*(be recognised, and we were too early, and went out to walk in a)Tj
T*(field just close by; I was always in a panic about this Leonards,)Tj

T*(we were in the field, the low red sunlight just in my face, some)Tj
T*(one came by on horseback in the road just below the field-style)Tj
T*(by which we stood. I saw him look at me, but I did not know who)Tj
T*(it was at first, the sun was so in my eyes, but in an instant the)Tj
T*(dazzle went off, and I saw it was Mr. Thornton, and we)Tj

T*(About this time Dixon returned from Milton, and assumed her post)Tj
T*(as Margaret's maid. She brought endless pieces of Milton gossip:)Tj
T*(How Martha had gone to live with Miss Thornton, on the latter's)Tj
T*(marriage; with an account of the bridesmaids, dresses and)Tj
T*(breakfasts, at that interesting ceremony; how people thought that)Tj
T*(Mr. Thornton had made too grand a wedding of it, considering he)Tj
T*(had lost a deal by the strike, and had had to pay so much for the)Tj
T*(failure of his contracts; how little money articles of)Tj
T*(furniture--long cherished by Dixon--had fetched at the sale,)Tj
T*(which was a shame considering how rich folks were at Milton; how)Tj
T*(Mrs. Thornton had come one day and got two or three good)Tj
T*(bargains, and Mr. Thornton had come the next, and in his desire)Tj
T*(to obtain one or two things, had bid against himself, much to the)Tj
T*(enjoyment of the bystanders, so as Dixon observed, that made)Tj
T*(things even; if Mrs. Thornton paid too little, Mr. Thornton paid)Tj
T*(too much. Mr. Bell had sent all sorts of orders about the books;)Tj
T*(there was no understanding him, he was so particular; if he had)Tj
T*(come himself it would have been all right, but letters always)Tj
T*(were and always will be more puzzling than they are worth. Dixon)Tj
T*(had not much to tell about the Higginses. Her memory had an)Tj
T*(aristocratic bias, and was very treacherous whenever she tried to)Tj
T*(recall any circumstance connected with those below her in life.)Tj
T*(Nicholas was very well she believed. He had been several times at)Tj
T*(the house asking for news of Miss Margaret--the only person who)Tj
T*(ever did ask, except once Mr. Thornton. And Mary? oh! of course)Tj
T*(she was very well, a great, stout, slatternly thing! She did)Tj
T*(hear, or perhaps it was only a dream of hers, though it would be)Tj
T*(strange if she had dreamt of such people as the Higginses, that)Tj
T*(Mary had gone to work at Mr. Thornton's mill, because her father)Tj
T*(wished her to know how to cook; but what nonsense that could mean)Tj
T*(she didn't know. Margaret rather agreed with her that the story)Tj
T*(was incoherent enough to be like a dream. Still it was pleasant)Tj
T*(to have some one now with whom she could talk of Milton, and)Tj
T*(Milton people. Dixon was not over-fond of the subject, rather)Tj
T*(wishing to leave that part of her life in shadow. She liked much)Tj
T*(more to dwell upon speeches of Mr. Bell's, which had suggested an)Tj
T*(idea to her of what was really his intention--making Margaret his)Tj

T*(mists would be cleared away. Mr. Bell's letters were hardly like)Tj
T*(his usual self; they were short, and complaining, with every now)Tj
T*(and then a little touch of bitterness that was unusual. He did)Tj
T*(not look forward to the future; he rather seemed to regret the)Tj
T*(past, and be weary of the present. Margaret fancied that he could)Tj
T*(not be well; but in answer to some enquiry of hers as to his)Tj
T*(health, he sent her a short note, saying there was an)Tj
T*(old-fashioned complaint called the spleen; that he was suffering)Tj
T*(from that, and it was for her to decide if it was more mental or)Tj
T*(physical; but that he should like to indulge himself in)Tj
T*(grumbling, without being obliged to send a bulletin every time.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In consequence of this note, Margaret made no more enquiries)Tj
T*(about his health. One day Edith let out accidentally a fragment)Tj
T*(of a conversation which she had had with Mr. Bell, when he was)Tj
T*(last in London, which possessed Margaret with the idea that he)Tj
T*(had some notion of taking her to pay a visit to her brother and)Tj
T*(new sister-in-law, at Cadiz, in the autumn. She questioned and)Tj
T*(cross-questioned Edith, till the latter was weary, and declared)Tj
T*(that there was nothing more to remember; all he had said was that)Tj
T*(he half-thought he should go, and hear for himself what Frederick)Tj
T*(had to say about the mutiny; and that it would be a good)Tj
T*(opportunity for Margaret to become acquainted with her new)Tj
T*(sister-in-law; that he always went somewhere during the long)Tj
T*(vacation, and did not see why he should not go to Spain as well)Tj
T*(as anywhere else. That was all. Edith hoped Margaret did not want)Tj
T*(to leave them, that she was so anxious about all this. And then,)Tj
T*(having nothing else particular to do, she cried, and said that)Tj
T*(she knew she cared much more for Margaret than Margaret did for)Tj
T*(her. Margaret comforted her as well as she could, but she could)Tj
T*(hardly explain to her how this idea of Spain, mere Chateau en)Tj
T*(Espagne as it might be, charmed and delighted her. Edith was in)Tj
T*(the mood to think that any pleasure enjoyed away from her was a)Tj
T*(tacit affront, or at best a proof of indifference. So Margaret)Tj
T*(had to keep her pleasure to herself, and could only let it escape)Tj
T*(by the safety-valve of asking Dixon, when she dressed for dinner,)Tj
T*(if she would not like to see Master Frederick and his new wife)Tj
T*(very much indeed?)Tj

T*(of term of endearment; but Dixon always winced away from the)Tj
T*(application of the word to herself, who, being not much past)Tj
T*(fifty, was, she thought, in the very prime of life. Secondly, she)Tj
T*(did not like being so easily taken at her word; she had, with all)Tj
T*(her terror, a lurking curiosity about Spain, the Inquisition, and)Tj
T*(Popish mysteries. So, after clearing her throat, as if to show)Tj
T*(her willingness to do away with difficulties, she asked Miss)Tj
T*(Hale, whether she thought if she took care never to see a priest,)Tj
T*(or enter into one of their churches, there would be so very much)Tj
T*(danger of her being converted? Master Frederick, to be sure, had)Tj

T*(Margaret was afraid of letting her mind run too much upon this)Tj
T*(Spanish plan. But it took off her thoughts from too impatiently)Tj
T*(dwelling upon her desire to have all explained to Mr. Thornton.)Tj
T*(Mr. Bell appeared for the present to be stationary at Oxford, and)Tj
T*(to have no immediate purpose of going to Milton, and some secret)Tj
T*(restraint seemed to hang over Margaret, and prevent her from even)Tj
T*(asking, or alluding again to any probability of such a visit on)Tj
T*(his part. Nor did she feel at liberty to name what Edith had told)Tj
T*(her of the idea he had entertained,--it might be but for five)Tj
T*(minutes,--of going to Spain. He had never named it at Helstone,)Tj
T*(during all that sunny day of leisure; it was very probably but)Tj
T*(the fancy of a moment,--but if it were true, what a bright outlet)Tj
T*(it would be from the monotony of her present life, which was)Tj
T*(beginning to fall upon her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One of the great pleasures of Margaret's life at this time, was)Tj
T*(in Edith's boy. He was the pride and plaything of both father and)Tj
T*(mother, as long as he was good; but he had a strong will of his)Tj
T*(own, and as soon as he burst out into one of his stormy passions,)Tj
T*(Edith would throw herself back in despair and fatigue, and sigh)Tj
T*(out, 'Oh dear, what shall I do with him! Do, Margaret, please)Tj
T*(ring the bell for Hanley.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But Margaret almost liked him better in these manifestations of)Tj
T*(character than in his good blue-sashed moods. She would carry him)Tj
T*(off into a room, where they two alone battled it out; she with a)Tj
T*(firm power which subdued him into peace, while every sudden charm)Tj
T*(and wile she possessed, was exerted on the side of right, until)Tj

T*(her a taste of the feeling that she believed would be denied to)Tj
T*(her for ever.)Tj

T*(Mr. Henry Lennox added a new and not disagreeable element to the)Tj

T*(cherished and faithful friend.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They had promised Edith before starting, that if all had ended as)Tj
T*(they feared, they would return to dinner; so that long, lingering)Tj
T*(look around the room in which her father had died, had to be)Tj
T*(interrupted, and a quiet farewell taken of the kind old face that)Tj
T*(had so often come out with pleasant words, and merry quips and)Tj
T*(cranks.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Captain Lennox fell asleep on their journey home; and Margaret)Tj
T*(could cry at leisure, and bethink her of this fatal year, and all)Tj
T*(the woes it had brought to her. No sooner was she fully aware of)Tj
T*(one loss than another came--not to supersede her grief for the)Tj
T*(one before, but to re-open wounds and feelings scarcely healed.)Tj
T*(But at the sound of the tender voices of her aunt and Edith, of)Tj
T*(merry little Sholto's glee at her arrival, and at the sight of)Tj
T*(the well-lighted rooms, with their mistress pretty in her)Tj
T*(paleness and her eager sorrowful interest, Margaret roused)Tj
T*(herself from her heavy trance of almost superstitious)Tj
T*(hopelessness, and began to feel that even around her joy and)Tj
T*(gladness might gather. She had Edith's place on the sofa; Sholto)Tj
T*(was taught to carry aunt Margaret's cup of tea very carefully to)Tj
T*(her; and by the time she went up to dress, she could thank God)Tj
T*(for having spared her dear old friend a long or a painful)Tj
T*(illness.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But when night came--solemn night, and all the house was quiet,)Tj
T*(Margaret still sate watching the beauty of a London sky at such)Tj
T*(an hour, on such a summer evening; the faint pink reflection of)Tj
T*(earthly lights on the soft clouds that float tranquilly into the)Tj
T*(white moonlight, out of the warm gloom which lies motionless)Tj
T*(around the horizon. Margaret's room had been the day nursery of)Tj
T*(her childhood, just when it merged into girlhood, and when the)Tj
T*(feelings and conscience had been first awakened into full)Tj
T*(activity. On some such night as this she remembered promising to)Tj
T*(herself to live as brave and noble a life as any heroine she ever)Tj
T*(read or heard of in romance, a life sans peur et sans reproche;)Tj
T*(it had seemed to her then that she had only to will, and such a)Tj
T*(life would be accomplished. And now she had learnt that not only)Tj
T*(to will, but also to pray, was a necessary condition in the truly)Tj
T*(heroic. Trusting to herself, she had fallen. It was a just)Tj
T*(consequence of her sin, that all excuses for it, all temptation)Tj
T*(to it, should remain for ever unknown to the person in whose)Tj
T*(opinion it had sunk her lowest. She stood face to face at last)Tj
T*(with her sin. She knew it for what it was; Mr. Bell's kindly)Tj
T*(sophistry that nearly all men were guilty of equivocal actions,)Tj
T*(and that the motive ennobled the evil, had never had much real)Tj
T*(weight with her. Her own first thought of how, if she had known)Tj
T*(all, she might have fearlessly told the truth, seemed low and)Tj
T*(poor. Nay, even now, her anxiety to have her character for truth)Tj
T*(partially excused in Mr. Thornton's eyes, as Mr. Bell had)Tj
T*(promised to do, was a very small and petty consideration, now)Tj
T*(that she was afresh taught by death what life should be. If all)Tj
T*(the world spoke, acted, or kept silence with intent to)Tj
T*(deceive,--if dearest interests were at stake, and dearest lives)Tj
T*(in peril,--if no one should ever know of her truth or her)Tj
T*(falsehood to measure out their honour or contempt for her by,)Tj
T*(straight alone where she stood, in the presence of God, she)Tj
T*(prayed that she might have strength to speak and act the truth)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Is not Margaret the heiress?' whispered Edith to her husband, as)Tj
T*(they were in their room alone at night after the sad journey to)Tj
T*(Oxford. She had pulled his tall head down, and stood upon tiptoe,)Tj
T*(and implored him not to be shocked, before she had ventured to)Tj
T*(ask this question. Captain Lennox was, however, quite in the)Tj
T*(dark; if he had ever heard, he had forgotten; it could not be)Tj
T*(much that a Fellow of a small college had to leave; but he had)Tj
T*(never wanted her to pay for her board; and two hundred and fifty)Tj
T*(pounds a year was something ridiculous, considering that she did)Tj
T*(not take wine. Edith came down upon her feet a little bit sadder;)Tj
T*(with a romance blown to pieces.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A week afterwards, she came prancing towards her husband, and)Tj
T*(made him a low curtsey:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I am right, and you are wrong, most noble Captain. Margaret has)Tj
T*(had a lawyer's letter, and she is residuary legatee--the legacies)Tj
T*(being about two thousand pounds, and the remainder about forty)Tj
T*(thousand, at the present value of property in Milton.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Indeed! and how does she take her good fortune?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, it seems she knew she was to have it all along; only she had)Tj
T*(no idea it was so much. She looks very white and pale, and says)Tj
T*(she's afraid of it; but that's nonsense, you know, and will soon)Tj
T*(go off. I left mamma pouring congratulations down her throat, and)Tj
T*(stole away to tell you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It seemed to be supposed, by general consent, that the most)Tj
T*(natural thing was to consider Mr. Lennox henceforward as)Tj
T*(Margaret's legal adviser. She was so entirely ignorant of all)Tj
T*(forms of business that in nearly everything she had to refer to)Tj
T*(him. He chose out her attorney; he came to her with papers to be)Tj
T*(signed. He was never so happy as when teaching her of what all)Tj

T*(commit myself, I will see my ground clear. Ask whom you choose.)Tj
T*(It may not be very civil, Edith, but if you meddle in it you will)Tj

T*(There was no Spain for Margaret that autumn; although to the last)Tj
T*(she hoped that some fortunate occasion would call Frederick to)Tj
T*(Paris, whither she could easily have met with a convoy. Instead)Tj
T*(of Cadiz, she had to content herself with Cromer. To that place)Tj
T*(her aunt Shaw and the Lennoxes were bound. They had all along)Tj
T*(wished her to accompany them, and, consequently, with their)Tj
T*(characters, they made but lazy efforts to forward her own)Tj
T*(separate wish. Perhaps Cromer was, in one sense of the)Tj
T*(expression, the best for her. She needed bodily strengthening and)Tj
T*(bracing as well as rest.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Among other hopes that had vanished, was the hope, the trust she)Tj
T*(had had, that Mr. Bell would have given Mr. Thornton the simple)Tj
T*(facts of the family circumstances which had preceded the)Tj
T*(unfortunate accident that led to Leonards' death. Whatever)Tj
T*(opinion--however changed it might be from what Mr. Thornton had)Tj
T*(once entertained, she had wished it to be based upon a true)Tj
T*(understanding of what she had done; and why she had done it. It)Tj
T*(would have been a pleasure to her; would have given her rest on a)Tj
T*(point on which she should now all her life be restless, unless)Tj
T*(she could resolve not to think upon it. It was now so long after)Tj
T*(the time of these occurrences, that there was no possible way of)Tj
T*(explaining them save the one which she had lost by Mr. Bell's)Tj
T*(death. She must just submit, like many another, to be)Tj
T*(misunderstood; but, though reasoning herself into the belief that)Tj
T*(in this hers was no uncommon lot, her heart did not ache the less)Tj
T*(with longing that some time--years and years hence--before he)Tj
T*(died at any rate, he might know how much she had been tempted.)Tj
T*(She thought that she did not want to hear that all was explained)Tj
T*(to him, if only she could be sure that he would know. But this)Tj
T*(wish was vain, like so many others; and when she had schooled)Tj
T*(herself into this conviction, she turned with all her heart and)Tj
T*(strength to the life that lay immediately before her, and)Tj
T*(resolved to strive and make the best of that.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She used to sit long hours upon the beach, gazing intently on the)Tj
T*(waves as they chafed with perpetual motion against the pebbly)Tj
T*(shore,--or she looked out upon the more distant heave, and)Tj
T*(sparkle against the sky, and heard, without being conscious of)Tj
T*(hearing, the eternal psalm, which went up continually. She was)Tj
T*(soothed without knowing how or why. Listlessly she sat there, on)Tj
T*(the ground, her hands clasped round her knees, while her aunt)Tj
T*(Shaw did small shoppings, and Edith and Captain Lennox rode far)Tj
T*(and wide on shore and inland. The nurses, sauntering on with)Tj
T*(their charges, would pass and repass her, and wonder in whispers)Tj
T*(what she could find to look at so long, day after day. And when)Tj

T*(in October.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But all this time for thought enabled Margaret to put events in)Tj
T*(their right places, as to origin and significance, both as)Tj
T*(regarded her past life and her future. Those hours by the)Tj
T*(sea-side were not lost, as any one might have seen who had had)Tj
T*(the perception to read, or the care to understand, the look that)Tj
T*(Margaret's face was gradually acquiring. Mr. Henry Lennox was)Tj
T*(excessively struck by the change.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The sea has done Miss Hale an immense deal of good, I should)Tj
T*(fancy,' said he, when she first left the room after his arrival)Tj
T*(in their family circle. 'She looks ten years younger than she did)Tj
T*(in Harley Street.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That's the bonnet I got her!' said Edith, triumphantly. 'I knew)Tj
T*(it would suit her the moment I saw it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I beg your pardon,' said Mr. Lennox, in the half-contemptuous,)Tj
T*(half-indulgent tone he generally used to Edith. 'But I believe I)Tj
T*(know the difference between the charms of a dress and the charms)Tj
T*(of a woman. No mere bonnet would have made Miss Hale's eyes so)Tj
T*(lustrous and yet so soft, or her lips so ripe and red--and her)Tj
T*(face altogether so full of peace and light.--She is like, and yet)Tj
T*(more,'--he dropped his voice,--'like the Margaret Hale of)Tj
T*(Helstone.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(From this time the clever and ambitious man bent all his powers)Tj
T*(to gaining Margaret. He loved her sweet beauty. He saw the latent)Tj
T*(sweep of her mind, which could easily \(he thought\) be led to)Tj
T*(embrace all the objects on which he had set his heart. He looked)Tj
T*(upon her fortune only as a part of the complete and superb)Tj
T*(character of herself and her position: yet he was fully aware of)Tj
T*(the rise which it would immediately enable him, the poor)Tj
T*(barrister, to take. Eventually he would earn such success, and)Tj
T*(such honours, as would enable him to pay her back, with interest,)Tj
T*(that first advance in wealth which he should owe to her. He had)Tj
T*(been to Milton on business connected with her property, on his)Tj
T*(return from Scotland; and with the quick eye of a skilled lawyer,)Tj
T*(ready ever to take in and weigh contingencies, he had seen that)Tj
T*(much additional value was yearly accruing to the lands and)Tj
T*(tenements which she owned in that prosperous and increasing town.)Tj
T*(He was glad to find that the present relationship between)Tj
T*(Margaret and himself, of client and legal adviser, was gradually)Tj
T*(superseding the recollection of that unlucky, mismanaged day at)Tj
T*(Helstone. He had thus unusual opportunities of intimate)Tj
T*(intercourse with her, besides those that arose from the)Tj
T*(connection between the families.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret was only too willing to listen as long as he talked of)Tj
T*(Milton, though he had seen none of the people whom she more)Tj
T*(especially knew. It had been the tone with her aunt and cousin to)Tj
T*(speak of Milton with dislike and contempt; just such feelings as)Tj
T*(Margaret was ashamed to remember she had expressed and felt on)Tj
T*(first going to live there. But Mr. Lennox almost exceeded)Tj
T*(Margaret in his appreciation of the character of Milton and its)Tj
T*(inhabitants. Their energy, their power, their indomitable courage)Tj

T*(talking about them; and had never perceived how selfish and)Tj
T*(material were too many of the ends they proposed to themselves as)Tj
T*(the result of all their mighty, untiring endeavour, till)Tj
T*(Margaret, even in the midst of her gratification, had the candour)Tj
T*(to point this out, as the tainting sin in so much that was noble,)Tj
T*(and to be admired. Still, when other subjects palled upon her,)Tj
T*(and she gave but short answers to many questions, Henry Lennox)Tj
T*(found out that an enquiry as to some Darkshire peculiarity of)Tj
T*(character, called back the light into her eye, the glow into her)Tj
T*(cheek.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When they returned to town, Margaret fulfilled one of her)Tj
T*(sea-side resolves, and took her life into her own hands. Before)Tj
T*(they went to Cromer, she had been as docile to her aunt's laws as)Tj
T*(if she were still the scared little stranger who cried herself to)Tj
T*(sleep that first night in the Harley Street nursery. But she had)Tj
T*(learnt, in those solemn hours of thought, that she herself must)Tj
T*(one day answer for her own life, and what she had done with it;)Tj
T*(and she tried to settle that most difficult problem for women,)Tj
T*(how much was to be utterly merged in obedience to authority, and)Tj
T*(how much might be set apart for freedom in working. Mrs. Shaw was)Tj
T*(as good-tempered as could be; and Edith had inherited this)Tj
T*(charming domestic quality; Margaret herself had probably the)Tj
T*(worst temper of the three, for her quick perceptions, and)Tj
T*(over-lively imagination made her hasty, and her early isolation)Tj
T*(from sympathy had made her proud; but she had an indescribable)Tj
T*(childlike sweetness of heart, which made her manners, even in her)Tj
T*(rarely wilful moods, irresistible of old; and now, chastened even)Tj
T*(by what the world called her good fortune, she charmed her)Tj
T*(reluctant aunt into acquiescence with her will. So Margaret)Tj
T*(gained the acknowledgment of her right to follow her own ideas of)Tj
T*(duty.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Only don't be strong-minded,' pleaded Edith. 'Mamma wants you to)Tj
T*(have a footman of your own; and I'm sure you're very welcome, for)Tj
T*(they're great plagues. Only to please me, darling, don't go and)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Meanwhile, at Milton the chimneys smoked, the ceaseless roar and)Tj
T*(mighty beat, and dizzying whirl of machinery, struggled and)Tj
T*(strove perpetually. Senseless and purposeless were wood and iron)Tj
T*(and steam in their endless labours; but the persistence of their)Tj
T*(monotonous work was rivalled in tireless endurance by the strong)Tj
T*(crowds, who, with sense and with purpose, were busy and restless)Tj
T*(in seeking after--What? In the streets there were few)Tj
T*(loiterers,--none walking for mere pleasure; every man's face was)Tj
T*(set in lines of eagerness or anxiety; news was sought for with)Tj
T*(fierce avidity; and men jostled each other aside in the Mart and)Tj
T*(in the Exchange, as they did in life, in the deep selfishness of)Tj
T*(competition. There was gloom over the town. Few came to buy, and)Tj
T*(those who did were looked at suspiciously by the sellers; for)Tj
T*(credit was insecure, and the most stable might have their)Tj
T*(fortunes affected by the sweep in the great neighbouring port)Tj
T*(among the shipping houses. Hitherto there had been no failures in)Tj
T*(Milton; but, from the immense speculations that had come to light)Tj
T*(in making a bad end in America, and yet nearer home, it was known)Tj
T*(that some Milton houses of business must suffer so severely that)Tj
T*(every day men's faces asked, if their tongues did not, 'What)Tj
T*(news? Who is gone? How will it affect me?' And if two or three)Tj

T*(his machinery is new within these two years, and has cost him--we)Tj
T*(won't say what!--a word to the wise!' But that Mr. Harrison was a)Tj
T*(croaker,--a man who had succeeded to his father's trade-made)Tj
T*(fortune, which he had feared to lose by altering his mode of)Tj
T*(business to any having a larger scope; yet he grudged every penny)Tj
T*(made by others more daring and far-sighted.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But the truth was, Mr. Thornton was hard pressed. He felt it)Tj
T*(acutely in his vulnerable point--his pride in the commercial)Tj
T*(character which he had established for himself. Architect of his)Tj
T*(own fortunes, he attributed this to no special merit or qualities)Tj
T*(of his own, but to the power, which he believed that commerce)Tj
T*(gave to every brave, honest, and persevering man, to raise)Tj
T*(himself to a level from which he might see and read the great)Tj
T*(game of worldly success, and honestly, by such far-sightedness,)Tj
T*(command more power and influence than in any other mode of life.)Tj
T*(Far away, in the East and in the West, where his person would)Tj
T*(never be known, his name was to be regarded, and his wishes to be)Tj
T*(fulfilled, and his word pass like gold. That was the idea of)Tj
T*(merchant-life with which Mr. Thornton had started. 'Her merchants)Tj
T*(be like princes,' said his mother, reading the text aloud, as if)Tj
T*(it were a trumpet-call to invite her boy to the struggle. He was)Tj
T*(but like many others--men, women, and children--alive to distant,)Tj
T*(and dead to near things. He sought to possess the influence of a)Tj
T*(name in foreign countries and far-away seas,--to become the head)Tj
T*(of a firm that should be known for generations; and it had taken)Tj
T*(him long silent years to come even to a glimmering of what he)Tj
T*(might be now, to-day, here in his own town, his own factory,)Tj
T*(among his own people. He and they had led parallel lives--very)Tj
T*(close, but never touching--till the accident \(or so it seemed\) of)Tj
T*(his acquaintance with Higgins. Once brought face to face, man to)Tj
T*(man, with an individual of the masses around him, and \(take)Tj
T*(notice\) out of the character of master and workman, in the first)Tj
T*(instance, they had each begun to recognise that 'we have all of)Tj
T*(us one human heart.' It was the fine point of the wedge; and)Tj
T*(until now, when the apprehension of losing his connection with)Tj
T*(two or three of the workmen whom he had so lately begun to know)Tj
T*(as men,--of having a plan or two, which were experiments lying)Tj
T*(very close to his heart, roughly nipped off without trial,--gave)Tj
T*(a new poignancy to the subtle fear that came over him from time)Tj
T*(to time; until now, he had never recognised how much and how deep)Tj
T*(was the interest he had grown of late to feel in his position as)Tj
T*(manufacturer, simply because it led him into such close contact,)Tj
T*(and gave him the opportunity of so much power, among a race of)Tj
T*(people strange, shrewd, ignorant; but, above all, full of)Tj
T*(character and strong human feeling.)Tj

T*(Thornton's way; and often, when his eye fell on Higgins, he could)Tj
T*(have spoken angrily to him without any present cause, just from)Tj
T*(feeling how serious was the injury that had arisen from this)Tj
T*(affair in which he was implicated. But when he became conscious)Tj
T*(of this sudden, quick resentment, he resolved to curb it. It)Tj
T*(would not satisfy him to avoid Higgins; he must convince himself)Tj
T*(that he was master over his own anger, by being particularly)Tj
T*(careful to allow Higgins access to him, whenever the strict rules)Tj
T*(of business, or Mr. Thornton's leisure permitted. And by-and-bye,)Tj
T*(he lost all sense of resentment in wonder how it was, or could)Tj
T*(be, that two men like himself and Higgins, living by the same)Tj
T*(trade, working in their different ways at the same object, could)Tj
T*(look upon each other's position and duties in so strangely)Tj
T*(different a way. And thence arose that intercourse, which though)Tj
T*(it might not have the effect of preventing all future clash of)Tj
T*(opinion and action, when the occasion arose, would, at any rate,)Tj
T*(enable both master and man to look upon each other with far more)Tj
T*(charity and sympathy, and bear with each other more patiently and)Tj
T*(kindly. Besides this improvement of feeling, both Mr. Thornton)Tj
T*(and his workmen found out their ignorance as to positive matters)Tj
T*(of fact, known heretofore to one side, but not to the other.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But now had come one of those periods of bad trade, when the)Tj
T*(market falling brought down the value of all large stocks; Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton's fell to nearly half. No orders were coming in; so he)Tj
T*(lost the interest of the capital he had locked up in machinery;)Tj
T*(indeed, it was difficult to get payment for the orders completed;)Tj
T*(yet there was the constant drain of expenses for working the)Tj
T*(business. Then the bills became due for the cotton he had)Tj
T*(purchased; and money being scarce, he could only borrow at)Tj
T*(exorbitant interest, and yet he could not realise any of his)Tj
T*(property. But he did not despair; he exerted himself day and)Tj
T*(night to foresee and to provide for all emergencies; he was as)Tj
T*(calm and gentle to the women in his home as ever; to the workmen)Tj
T*(in his mill he spoke not many words, but they knew him by this)Tj
T*(time; and many a curt, decided answer was received by them rather)Tj
T*(with sympathy for the care they saw pressing upon him, than with)Tj
T*(the suppressed antagonism which had formerly been smouldering,)Tj
T*(and ready for hard words and hard judgments on all occasions.)Tj
T*('Th' measter's a deal to potter him,' said Higgins, one day, as)Tj
T*(he heard Mr. Thornton's short, sharp inquiry, why such a command)Tj
T*(had not been obeyed; and caught the sound of the suppressed sigh)Tj
T*(which he heaved in going past the room where some of the men were)Tj
T*(working. Higgins and another man stopped over-hours that night,)Tj
T*(unknown to any one, to get the neglected piece of work done; and)Tj
T*(Mr. Thornton never knew but that the overlooker, to whom he had)Tj
T*(given the command in the first instance, had done it himself.)Tj

T*('Eh! I reckon I know who'd ha' been sorry for to see our measter)Tj
T*(sitting so like a piece o' grey calico! Th' ou'd parson would ha')Tj
T*(fretted his woman's heart out, if he'd seen the woeful looks I)Tj
T*(have seen on our measter's face,' thought Higgins, one day, as he)Tj
T*(was approaching Mr. Thornton in Marlborough Street.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Measter,' said he, stopping his employer in his quick resolved)Tj
T*(walk, and causing that gentleman to look up with a sudden annoyed)Tj

T*(entered, to Edith and Captain Lennox.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Margaret looked with an anxious eye at Mr. Thornton while he was)Tj
T*(thus occupied. It was considerably more than a year since she had)Tj
T*(seen him; and events had occurred to change him much in that)Tj
T*(time. His fine figure yet bore him above the common height of)Tj
T*(men; and gave him a distinguished appearance, from the ease of)Tj
T*(motion which arose out of it, and was natural to him; but his)Tj
T*(face looked older and care-worn; yet a noble composure sate upon)Tj
T*(it, which impressed those who had just been hearing of his)Tj
T*(changed position, with a sense of inherent dignity and manly)Tj
T*(strength. He was aware, from the first glance he had given round)Tj
T*(the room, that Margaret was there; he had seen her intent look of)Tj
T*(occupation as she listened to Mr. Henry Lennox; and he came up to)Tj
T*(her with the perfectly regulated manner of an old friend. With)Tj
T*(his first calm words a vivid colour flashed into her cheeks,)Tj
T*(which never left them again during the evening. She did not seem)Tj
T*(to have much to say to him. She disappointed him by the quiet way)Tj
T*(in which she asked what seemed to him to be the merely necessary)Tj
T*(questions respecting her old acquaintances, in Milton; but others)Tj
T*(came in--more intimate in the house than he--and he fell into the)Tj
T*(background, where he and Mr. Lennox talked together from time to)Tj
T*(time.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You think Miss Hale looking well,' said Mr. Lennox, 'don't you?)Tj
T*(Milton didn't agree with her, I imagine; for when she first came)Tj
T*(to London, I thought I had never seen any one so much changed.)Tj
T*(To-night she is looking radiant. But she is much stronger. Last)Tj
T*(autumn she was fatigued with a walk of a couple of miles. On)Tj
T*(Friday evening we walked up to Hampstead and back. Yet on)Tj
T*(Saturday she looked as well as she does now.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('We!' Who? They two alone?)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Colthurst was a very clever man, and a rising member of)Tj
T*(parliament. He had a quick eye at discerning character, and was)Tj
T*(struck by a remark which Mr. Thornton made at dinner-time. He)Tj
T*(enquired from Edith who that gentleman was; and, rather to her)Tj
T*(surprise, she found, from the tone of his 'Indeed!' that Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton of Milton was not such an unknown name to him as she had)Tj
T*(imagined it would be. Her dinner was going off well. Henry was in)Tj
T*(good humour, and brought out his dry caustic wit admirably. Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton and Mr. Colthurst found one or two mutual subjects of)Tj
T*(interest, which they could only touch upon then, reserving them)Tj
T*(for more private after-dinner talk. Margaret looked beautiful in)Tj
T*(the pomegranate flowers; and if she did lean back in her chair)Tj
T*(and speak but little, Edith was not annoyed, for the conversation)Tj
T*(flowed on smoothly without her. Margaret was watching Mr.)Tj
T*(Thornton's face. He never looked at her; so she might study him)Tj
T*(unobserved, and note the changes which even this short time had)Tj
T*(wrought in him. Only at some unexpected mot of Mr. Lennox's, his)Tj
T*(face flashed out into the old look of intense enjoyment; the)Tj
T*(merry brightness returned to his eyes, the lips just parted to)Tj
T*(suggest the brilliant smile of former days; and for an instant,)Tj
T*(his glance instinctively sought hers, as if he wanted her)Tj
T*(sympathy. But when their eyes met, his whole countenance changed;)Tj
T*(he was grave and anxious once more; and he resolutely avoided)Tj
T*(even looking near her again during dinner.)Tj

T*(went up into the drawing-room, Margaret languidly employed)Tj
T*(herself about some work. Presently the gentlemen came up, Mr.)Tj
T*(Colthurst and Mr. Thornton in close conversation. Mr. Lennox drew)Tj
T*(near to Margaret, and said in a low voice:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I really think Edith owes me thanks for my contribution to her)Tj
T*(party. You've no idea what an agreeable, sensible fellow this)Tj
T*(tenant of yours is. He has been the very man to give Colthurst)Tj
T*(all the facts he wanted coaching in. I can't conceive how he)Tj
T*(contrived to mismanage his affairs.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('With his powers and opportunities you would have succeeded,')Tj
T*(said Margaret. He did not quite relish the tone in which she)Tj
T*(spoke, although the words but expressed a thought which had)Tj
T*(passed through his own mind. As he was silent, they caught a)Tj
T*(swell in the sound of conversation going on near the fire-place)Tj
T*(between Mr. Colthurst and Mr. Thornton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I assure you, I heard it spoken of with great)Tj
T*(interest--curiosity as to its result, perhaps I should rather)Tj
T*(say. I heard your name frequently mentioned during my short stay)Tj
T*(in the neighbourhood.' Then they lost some words; and when next)Tj
T*(they could hear Mr. Thornton was speaking.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I have not the elements for popularity--if they spoke of me in)Tj
T*(that way, they were mistaken. I fall slowly into new projects;)Tj
T*(and I find it difficult to let myself be known, even by those)Tj
T*(whom I desire to know, and with whom I would fain have no)Tj
T*(reserve. Yet, even with all these drawbacks, I felt that I was on)Tj
T*(the right path, and that, starting from a kind of friendship with)Tj
T*(one, I was becoming acquainted with many. The advantages were)Tj
T*(mutual: we were both unconsciously and consciously teaching each)Tj
T*(other.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You say "were." I trust you are intending to pursue the same)Tj
T*(course?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I must stop Colthurst,' said Henry Lennox, hastily. And by an)Tj
T*(abrupt, yet apropos question, he turned the current of the)Tj
T*(conversation, so as not to give Mr. Thornton the mortification of)Tj
T*(acknowledging his want of success and consequent change of)Tj
T*(position. But as soon as the newly-started subject had come to a)Tj
T*(close, Mr. Thornton resumed the conversation just where it had)Tj
T*(been interrupted, and gave Mr. Colthurst the reply to his)Tj
T*(inquiry.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I have been unsuccessful in business, and have had to give up my)Tj
T*(position as a master. I am on the look out for a situation in)Tj
T*(Milton, where I may meet with employment under some one who will)Tj
T*(be willing to let me go along my own way in such matters as)Tj
T*(these. I can depend upon myself for having no go-ahead theories)Tj
T*(that I would rashly bring into practice. My only wish is to have)Tj
T*(the opportunity of cultivating some intercourse with the hands)Tj
T*(beyond the mere "cash nexus." But it might be the point)Tj
T*(Archimedes sought from which to move the earth, to judge from the)Tj
T*(importance attached to it by some of our manufacturers, who shake)Tj
T*(their heads and look grave as soon as I name the one or two)Tj

T*('You call them "experiments" I notice,' said Mr. Colthurst, with)Tj
T*(a delicate increase of respect in his manner.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Because I believe them to be such. I am not sure of the)Tj
T*(consequences that may result from them. But I am sure they ought)Tj
T*(to be tried. I have arrived at the conviction that no mere)Tj
T*(institutions, however wise, and however much thought may have)Tj
T*(been required to organise and arrange them, can attach class to)Tj
T*(class as they should be attached, unless the working out of such)Tj
T*(institutions bring the individuals of the different classes into)Tj
T*(actual personal contact. Such intercourse is the very breath of)Tj
T*(life. A working man can hardly be made to feel and know how much)Tj
T*(his employer may have laboured in his study at plans for the)Tj
T*(benefit of his workpeople. A complete plan emerges like a piece)Tj
T*(of machinery, apparently fitted for every emergency. But the)Tj
T*(hands accept it as they do machinery, without understanding the)Tj
T*(intense mental labour and forethought required to bring it to)Tj
T*(such perfection. But I would take an idea, the working out of)Tj
T*(which would necessitate personal intercourse; it might not go)Tj
T*(well at first, but at every hitch interest would be felt by an)Tj
T*(increasing number of men, and at last its success in working come)Tj
T*(to be desired by all, as all had borne a part in the formation of)Tj
T*(the plan; and even then I am sure that it would lose its)Tj
T*(vitality, cease to be living, as soon as it was no longer carried)Tj
T*(on by that sort of common interest which invariably makes people)Tj
T*(find means and ways of seeing each other, and becoming acquainted)Tj
T*(with each others' characters and persons, and even tricks of)Tj
T*(temper and modes of speech. We should understand each other)Tj
T*(better, and I'll venture to say we should like each other more.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And you think they may prevent the recurrence of strikes?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not at all. My utmost expectation only goes so far as this--that)Tj
T*(they may render strikes not the bitter, venomous sources of)Tj
T*(hatred they have hitherto been. A more hopeful man might imagine)Tj
T*(that a closer and more genial intercourse between classes might)Tj
T*(do away with strikes. But I am not a hopeful man.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Suddenly, as if a new idea had struck him, he crossed over to)Tj
T*(where Margaret was sitting, and began, without preface, as if he)Tj
T*(knew she had been listening to all that had passed:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Miss Hale, I had a round-robin from some of my men--I suspect in)Tj
T*(Higgins' handwriting--stating their wish to work for me, if ever)Tj
T*(I was in a position to employ men again on my own behalf. That)Tj
T*(was good, wasn't it?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes. Just right. I am glad of it,' said Margaret, looking up)Tj
T*(straight into his face with her speaking eyes, and then dropping)Tj
T*(them under his eloquent glance. He gazed back at her for a)Tj
T*(minute, as if he did not know exactly what he was about. Then)Tj
T*(sighed; and saying, 'I knew you would like it,' he turned away,)Tj
T*(and never spoke to her again until he bid her a formal 'good)Tj
T*(night.')Tj

T*(As Mr. Lennox took his departure, Margaret said, with a blush)Tj
T*(that she could not repress, and with some hesitation,)Tj

T*('Happy and fortunate in all a man cares for, he does not)Tj

T*(back to the starting-point which requires the hopeful energy of)Tj
